"CA","Last updated April 6, 2021 at 8:41 AM Appointments are available for people with a high chance of exposure, high-risk, and those 50 or older. Sign up at  myturn.ca.gov or call (833) 422-4255 to find out if it’s your turn. If you’re eligible, you can schedule an appointment, or register to be notified when one is available.  Vaccination is one of the most important tools to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The State will equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine to everyone in California who wants it.  All Californians 50 or older are now eligible for vaccination. Every Californian 16 and up will be eligible for vaccination on April 15, 2021. On this page: California is allocating COVID-19 vaccines as they become available to ensure equitable distribution. Vaccinations are prioritized according to risk and age. Healthcare workers and long-term care residents (Phase 1A) Now vaccinating People with a high chance of exposure and those 65 or older (Phase 1B) Sector populations with high chance of exposure: Now vaccinating Individuals age 16 or older at higher risk  People with certain significant high-risk: Now vaccinating Individuals 50 or older Now vaccinating Every Californian 16 or older Vaccination of people younger than 16 will start as soon as the COVID-19 vaccines are approved for them  Starts April 15, 2021 See CDPH’s Updated COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Guidelines for details. Learn more about the plan Individuals at higher risk Vaccinations are available for the estimated 4.4 million people in California at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness. This includes those with certain significant high-risk medical conditions, disabilities, illness, living spaces, or work environments. Individuals with these conditions are strongly encouraged to check first with your usual health care provider. They can advise if you can get your vaccination with them, or in an alternate clinical setting. Healthcare providers may use their clinical judgement to vaccinate individuals aged 16-64 who are deemed to be at highest risk to get very sick from COVID-19 due to the following severe health conditions: Healthcare providers may also vaccinate individuals with  developmental or other severe disabilities or illness if: These include people with a range of physical and behavioral disabilities, such as: See CDPH’s Health Care Information Notice for details. Individuals who live or work in a congregate residential setting are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, which includes:   These settings are at high risk for outbreaks and have a concentration of individuals with high-risk chronic health conditions. This includes people experiencing homelessness, who may transition into congregate settings at short notice. Public transit workers, including airport workers for commercial airlines (but not private airplanes), will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. They are at high risk for occupational exposure, and maintaining continuity of transportation operations is critical. Find out more about eligibility requirements from the CDPH: Equity for hardest-hit communities California must end the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly and effectively as possible by vaccinating those most at risk of serious outcomes and those who have been most exposed at work or in their daily lives. This will protect not just those who are vaccinated, but reduce additional community transmission. By targeting vaccines to those who most need them, we can also begin to safely reopen activities across our economy.   The state will continue to double the amount of vaccine allocated to the lowest HPI quartile as announced on March 4 for four weeks beginning the week of March 22. Currently, the state is directing 40% of vaccine doses to the hardest-hit areas of the state based on the lowest quartile of the Public Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI).  How you will be vaccinated depends on when you are eligible and the available supply at the time you are eligible.  Verify your eligibility or schedule with My Turn Every Californian can sign up at myturn.ca.gov or call (833) 422-4255 to see if it’s their turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  People with a high chance of exposure, high-risk, and those 50 or older are eligible for vaccination and can schedule appointments now. If you’re eligible, and live or work in certain counties, you can schedule an appointment through My Turn. Appointments are available in Spanish. If it’s not your turn yet or appointments are not available, you can register to be notified when you’re eligible or when appointments open up. Due to high demand and limited supply, each county is setting their own geographic requirements. Most limit vaccination to those who live or work within the county. Appointments may be cancelled if you don’t meet the local requirements. Check the county’s vaccination website to make sure you are eligible before making an appointment. Educators and childcare providers under age 50 will be able to book an appointment on myturn.ca.gov with a special access code. The state is working with local education and childcare organizations to distribute these codes. Learn more about the K-12 school staff and childcare vaccine allocation plan. Schedule your vaccination  Schedule with a local provider Some local health jurisdictions provide vaccination appointments separately from My Turn. You can use the CDC VaccineFinder tool to find vaccination locations near you: Find vaccinations near you Most Californians will be vaccinated at: COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.  If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.  Vaccine safety  COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. These vaccines were authorized only after it was found that they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19. The authorized vaccines are up to 95% effective against a person becoming ill with COVID-19. The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, using both established and new safety monitoring systems. These vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. Learn more facts about COVID-19 vaccines. Results from monitoring efforts are reassuring. Many people have reported only mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Some people have no side effects. The vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19. Benefits of getting vaccinated COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. But they have other benefits, too: COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help us get back to normal. Read more at CDC’s Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine. You may have mild side effects After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. Your arm may hurt where you got your shot or you may have redness or swelling. You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea.  They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Learn more about Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine. If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to: COVID-19 Response Toolkit page to find These dashboards make vaccination data transparent and accessible to all Californians. They are updated daily. Vaccine administration by county of residence This dashboard reports vaccines administered by the county of residence. Where the county of residence was not reported, the county where vaccinated is used. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations because some out-of-state residents are vaccinated in California. Note: Doses delivered include the CDC Long Term Care (LTC) Pharmacy Partnership Program, Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program, Federal Dialysis Center Program, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) partner sites, and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) partner sites. This does not include doses delivered to the following federal agencies: Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense, and Federal Bureau of Prisons. The CDC LTC Pharmacy and Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program doses are a subset of the doses delivered. Vaccination and community health conditions (Vaccine Equity Metric) These graphs compare COVID-19 vaccinations among four different levels of community health. The Vaccine Equity Metric combines the Public Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI) measure with CDPH-derived scores to estimate factors that impact health, like income, education, and access to health care. Zip codes range from less healthy community conditions in Quartile 1 to more healthy community conditions in Quartile 4. Note: The Vaccine Equity Metric is for weekly vaccination allocation and reporting purposes only. CDPH-derived quartiles should not be considered as indicative of the HPI score for these zip codes. CDPH-derived quartiles were assigned to zip codes excluded from the HPI score produced by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California due to concerns with statistical reliability and validity in populations smaller than 1,500 or where more than 50% of the population resides in a group setting. Vaccination by groups The distribution of first vaccine doses by race and ethnicity, age, and gender is shown below. Providing this information is voluntary and not required for vaccination.  Data shows the cumulative total administered. Vaccinating all 58 counties requires partnership between the State, local health jurisdictions and all vaccinators to manage and use inventory. See how providers are tracking vaccines on hand and administered. Vaccines allocation and distribution Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change.  Using the federal allocation as a starting point, the state considers recommendations from the leadership of local health jurisdictions and the state’s third-party administrator, Blue Shield of California, to make decisions about how best to allocate vaccine supply in the state for efficient and equitable delivery of vaccinations. In addition to adjusting allocations to target eligible populations the state is directing 40% of vaccine doses to the hardest hit areas of the state based on the lowest quartile of the Healthy Places Index (HPI). See the most recent allocation. Local providers place orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to local providers. It can take a week or longer for allocation by the federal government to arrive at public health offices or providers for administration. See myCAvax Provider Enrollment instructions for steps to sign up. Also read the CDPH’s COVID-19 vaccine provider enrollment and training requirements. Getting vaccinated If two shots are required, get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible, but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over. Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested. Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free. Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s Know Your Health Care Rights. No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status. The agriculture and food sector populations (under Phase 1B) for COVID-19 vaccination include: See CDPH’s Updated COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Guidelines for details. The emergency services sector populations (under Phase 1B) for COVID-19 vaccination include: See CDPH’s Updated COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Guidelines for details. The education and childcare sector populations (under Phase 1B) for COVID-19 vaccination include: See CDPH’s Updated COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Guidelines for details. Yes, massage therapists are considered Phase 1A under Alternative Medical Practitioners. Yes, janitors are eligible for a vaccine. Janitors provide support to the health care, emergency services, and education sectors for Phase 1A and Phase 1B. This includes a vast majority of sectors with janitorial support. As a practical matter and for ease of implementation, all janitors are eligible. Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for ending isolation. Those without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine. Vaccines for people with high-risk medical conditions or disabilities There are five ways you can find an appointment. Vaccine supply remains limited nationwide. You will be asked to state that you have a high-risk medical condition or disability, either to book an available appointment or to register for notice of future appointments made available as supply increases. You will be able to request an accommodation at your vaccine site through MyTurn.   To protect confidentiality, verification of the diagnosis or type of disability is not required. Instead, anyone meeting the eligibility requirements will be asked to sign a self-attestation that they meet the criteria for high-risk medical conditions or disabilities. Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to ensure sites and services are accessible in accordance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements. Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy. Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy. If you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s member service department to request assistance for transportation to receive covered benefits. If you receive Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation (NMT) providers in your county and you can contact them directly to arrange transportation to your appointments.  If there is not a provider in your area, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) can assist if you email them DHCSNMT@dhcs.ca.gov. Please do NOT include personal information in your first email. DHCS staff will reply with a secure email asking for your information about the appointment.  If you have a need for Non-Emergency Medical Transportation, please inform your medical provider who can prescribe this service and put you in touch with a transportation provider to coordinate your ride to and from your appointment(s). What to expect after vaccination No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on viral tests. If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus. California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified. Read more at CDPH’s California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions. Vaccine limitations It depends. CDC recommends that: The ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines include: Buffers help maintain the stability of the pH solution.  The Janssen vaccine includes the following ingredients:  These vaccines do not contain: To learn more about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see The CDC recommends that: People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines provided they have not had an immediate or severe allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination considerations for people with underlying medical conditions. Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. Yes. The CDC recommends that if you are pregnant, you may choose to be vaccinated when it’s available to you. There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may also receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. There is no routine recommendation for taking a pregnancy test before you get a COVID-19 vaccine.If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talk with a healthcare provider to help you make an informed decision. The CDC recommends: The CDC recommends: Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for children: Clinical trials are ongoing to identify a safe vaccine for children. Vaccine choices It depends. Check with your health care provider about which vaccine they have available. No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government.  Once more and more Californians see how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccines are, we hope they will voluntarily opt to receive them. Yes. An employer may require employees to receive FDA-approved vaccination against COVID-19 infection so long as the employer: Read more at DFEH’s Employment information on COVID-19. Talking with family and friends about the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can be hard. You can help by listening without judgement and identifying the root of their concerns. Things to remember to help open the discussion include: The CDC has recommendations on how to talk about COVID-19 vaccines with friends and family. Vaccine committees and workgroups A group of experts and a group of community representatives work together to make sure vaccine distribution is prioritized fairly.  California formed a Scientific Safety Review Workgroup of experts to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This workgroup has confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA are safe and effective."

This genetic code isn’t a live virus, and it can’t change your genes. mRNA vaccine: Moderna’s vaccine uses single-stranded mRNA to teach your body how to fight COVID-19. This genetic code isn’t a live virus, and it can’t change your genes. Viral vector vaccine:  Janssen’s vaccine uses double-stranded DNA inside a modified, harmless adenovirus to teach your body how to fight COVID-19. This vaccine doesn’t contain a live virus, and it can’t change your genes. Two doses:  Pfizer’s vaccine requires two doses, given 21 days apart. Two doses:  Moderna’s vaccine requires two doses, given 28 days apart. One dose:  Janssen’s vaccine requires only one dose. Side effects:  The most common side effects of all three vaccines are tiredness, headaches, body aches, and redness or pain at the injection site. Side effects may be more pronounced after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine. Monitoring for allergic reactions:  After receiving any of the three available vaccines, you’ll be monitored for rare severe allergic reactions. You should be monitored for 15 minutes after vaccination, or 30 minutes if you have a history of anaphylaxis. Testing:  Phase 3 trials included 46,331 participants from six countries. 42% identified as Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino/a, or Native American. Testing:  Phase 3 trials included 30,000 participants from the U.S. About 37% of volunteers identified as Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino/a, or other. Testing:  Phase 3 trials included 43,783 participants from the U.S., Latin America, and South Africa. 77.7% identified as Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino/a, or Native American. This trial ran while variant strains were circulating around the world.  Storage:  Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be stored in ultra-cold freezers in order to stay effective. Storage:  Moderna’s vaccine needs to be frozen, but not in ultra-cold freezers. Storage:  Janssen’s vaccine can be stored for up to three months at normal refrigerator temperatures. Safety: After looking at data from clinical trials, the FDA found all three vaccines to be safe and effective at preventing severe COVID-19 disease. Vaccines in phase 3 clinical trials: Astrazeneca, Novavax Safety and effectiveness of the vaccines Vaccines must be proven to be safe and effective before they are given to people. The COVID-19 vaccines are no different. These vaccines are being proven safe every day, as hundreds of thousands of Coloradans -– doctors, nurses, seniors, and others -– have already taken them. Nationally, many millions of people have also received the vaccine. Once a company develops a vaccine, it must go through a rigorous scientific testing process before it can submit the vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Each phase of this process includes clinical research studies or trials. People volunteer to take part in these trials. Each trial emphasizes the safety of the vaccine on people. The trials also show researchers how well the vaccine works. As the research moves to the next phase, the group of volunteers becomes bigger to include more diversity in people and circumstances. A diverse group of people volunteered to participate in every phase of the clinical trials, including populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 due to generations of systemic inequities.  The FDA independently reviews the information from these tests to make sure the vaccine is safe and works well. It then decides whether the vaccine can be made available to the public. All vaccines must undergo this rigorous scientific process. The FDA held the COVID-19 vaccines to the same safety standards as other vaccines. Why should I consider getting vaccinated? So we can go back to the Colorado we love. Getting as many of us vaccinated as possible will hopefully allow us to achieve widespread community immunity so we can get back to the things we love. This past year has been tough, and we’ve suffered through a lot. The vaccines will help us get back to work, back to spending time with family, and back to a more normal life. To help protect people from getting COVID-19. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is an effective way to stop people from getting really sick or dying from COVID-19. Being vaccinated means that you are protected from getting seriously ill. It may also reduce the chance that you could spread COVID-19 to others who are more vulnerable. The vaccines are free whether or not you have health insurance or are a U.S. citizen. The vaccines are free. Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance will cover the cost of the COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, uninsured Coloradans will have access to free vaccines. Providers cannot turn away anyone because they can’t pay for the vaccine or don’t have health insurance. Providers also cannot require ID before offering you a vaccine. State and local public health agencies will never share your information for any immigration or law enforcement purposes. And receiving the COVID-19 vaccine will not count against you in any public charge determinations.   What can I expect at my vaccine appointment? For more information, see the following links: The CDC and FDA are closely monitoring COVID-19 vaccine(s) for new risks and serious side effects. We highly encourage the public to report possible side effects (called adverse events) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This national system collects the data to look for adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected, or have unusual patterns of occurrence. Anyone can submit a report, including parents, patients, and health care professionals. Reporting to VAERS helps the CDC monitor the safety of vaccines. Sign up for v-safe Sign up for v-safe CDC’s v-safe is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. When you receive your vaccine, you should also receive a v-safe information sheet telling you how to enroll in v-safe. If you enroll, you will receive regular text messages directing you to surveys where you can report any problems or adverse reactions you have after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. V-safe is available in English, Korean, simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Vietnamese.   → Where can I get vaccinated?  Colorado is currently vaccinating eligible Coloradans for Phase 1. Coloradans in Phase 2 will be eligible beginning April 2. . For more information about when you can get a vaccine, visit our eligibility webpage. Vaccines can save lives, but so can you.  Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available to us. To slow the spread of disease, Coloradans should continue to use basic public health guidance, like physical distancing and mask wearing, until a vaccine is widely available and used by Coloradans.

"CT","  CT Vaccine Portal COVID-19 Vaccination FAQ ... COVID-19 Vaccination FAQ CT Vaccine Portal COVID-19 Vaccination FAQs Welcome to our Frequently Asked Questions page! For quicker results, click on the links below to navigate to the section of information that you're searching for. Eligibility and Requirements I live out of state, but attend school in Connecticut.  Can I get my vaccine here? If you are attending boarding school or college in the state of Connecticut but your residence is outside of Connecticut, you can receive your vaccine here.  You must be currently attending school in person in Connecticut in order to be eligible to receive your shot here.  If you are attending school remotely outside of Connecticut, you much receive your vaccine in your home state. When will children under the age of 16 be eligible for the vaccine? Clinical trials in children between the ages of 12-15 are currently underway and clinical trials for younger children are anticipated in the months to come. Children under 16 years old will be eligible to receive the vaccine based on authorization by the federal government and the Science Subcommittee of Governor Lamont’s Vaccine Advisory Group. Is the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory? No.  The State of Connecticut is not mandating vaccination.   I am an educator, how do I get an appointment?  Do I have to go through my school/school district? Will I have to show identification? You should have heard from your employer and/or your local health director about options for appointments to receive your first dose.  There are closed clinics available to school personnel, childcare workers and others. Individuals eligible to receive vaccine because they work with children in childcare or pre-K through 12 settings must bring verification of their employment to the vaccine clinic.  Such verification could include an employee ID card, a paystub, or a letter from the employer. I live in town X but teach in town Y, where do I get my vaccine? You should have received options from your employer/school district for how and where you can make appointments/receive the vaccine. Scheduling your Vaccination Can I support my parents, grandparents, neighbors or others who need help scheduling online in finding an appointment?  Yes, you can.  Each person signing up through the VAMS system requires their own, distinct email address, and that is likely true for other scheduling systems as well. So, you may need to provide support in creating an email in addition to helping with scheduling.  Should I call my doctor to schedule a vaccine appointment?  No, do not call your doctor. Not every medical provider is administering vaccine at this time. Those who are will contact their patients to schedule appointments.  What if I can’t schedule an appointment when my window opens up?  Currently, the state’s weekly supply of vaccines is smaller than the demand for vaccines.  While the supply of doses from the federal government is increasing, we are still several weeks away from having a supply that will meet demand.  Therefore, when we open up new age groups for vaccination, there will be delays in getting appointments. We ask for everyone’s patience and please know that you will get an appointment, but it might take some time for appointments to open up. Can 16 and 17 year old individuals schedule their own vaccine appointments? Appointment scheduling processes vary across different vaccine providers. While some scheduling platforms, such as VAMS, allow minors to create personal accounts and schedule appointments, others may require a parent or guardian’s electronic permission to schedule. Minors under the age of 18 cannot be vaccinated by a healthcare provider without parental consent. Are there other restrictions on 16 and 17 year olds receiving vaccine? Currently, 16 and 17 year olds can only receive the Pfizer vaccine.  That is the only vaccine approved by the FDA for children ages 16 and 17.  When signing up for a vaccine appointment, make sure that the location you are choosing is administering the Pfizer vaccine.  How do I cancel my vaccine appointment? If you can no longer attend your scheduled vaccine appointment, it is critical that you cancel and reschedule your appointment as soon as possible.  With high demand for appointments and limited availability, cancelling your appointment allows someone else the opportunity to fill that slot and get their vaccination. If you scheduled your appointment using VAMS or MyChart, you can reschedule or cancel your appointment through your online account.  If you scheduled your appointment directly with a vaccine provider, contact the provider directly to understand your rescheduling options.  If you scheduled your appointment by calling the Vaccine Appointment Assist Line (877-918-2224), you can reschedule or cancel your appointment by dialing 877-918-2224 or 2-1-1.  How do I cancel my appointment in VAMS? To reschedule or cancel an appointment, log into the VAMS Recipient Portal and in the ""My Appointments"" tab, click the ""View details/Modify"" link next to the appointment you would like to reschedule. Select ""Reschedule appointment"" or ""Cancel appointment"" at the bottom of the details page and then follow the prompts. How do I cancel my appointment in MyChart or MyChartPlus? To cancel or reschedule appointments via your computer, log into MyChart, click “Visits”, and then ""Appointments and Visits"". Then, locate the appointment you would like to cancel or reschedule. If rescheduling, you will be prompted to select a new date and time and confirm.  To cancel or reschedule appointments via your MyChart mobile app, open the app and click ""Appointments"". Then, locate the appointment you would like to cancel or reschedule. If rescheduling, you will be prompted to select a new date and time and confirm. Privacy If I get a vaccination, where will my information go? Can I be sure it will be kept safe? Your personal and health care information will be kept private, and will not be shared outside of your healthcare provider's office, and the Department of Public Health. Personal identifying information such as your name, contact information, and address will be treated as confidential health care information and will not be shared with law enforcement or the federal government without a court order or similar legal compulsion.  Getting the Vaccine Where do I go for a vaccination?  If you are eligible for vaccination, you can schedule an appointment with any vaccine provider in the state with available appointments. Vaccines are administered in a wide range of places: physician’s offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and other locations that would normally administer vaccinations. Please visit www.covidvaccinefinder.ct.gov to view vaccine clinic locations near you. I don't have state-issued identification, will I be able to get a COVID-19 vaccination?  Yes, you can still be vaccinated.  No person will be turned away based on their ability to show ID. While sharing your contact information may not be required to get a vaccine, staff at the vaccination site may ask individuals for an ID, but this only applies to people who have one. Individuals should bring an ID, if they have one, to verify the name and eligibility information they submitted to the vaccination appointment system, their insurance information if they have insurance, and their employment in Connecticut if they work but do not live in the state. Individuals can still get the COVID-19 vaccine without insurance or an ID. Am I going to be required to carry verification that I’ve been vaccinated?  No. Although your provider will make sure that their records reflect you have received vaccine in order to most effectively treat you in the future.  Can I get a certificate that says I am vaccinated? Most providers will give you a card when they administer your first vaccine dose that notes the date and reminds you of your next appointment to receive the second dose.  The State is currently exploring options for providing some form of vaccine verification beyond the cards in use now by vaccine administrators. Do I have to pay for the vaccine? Vaccines are administered free of charge in Connecticut.  No one should be charged an out of pocket fee for receiving the vaccine.  If you have health insurance, the vaccine provider can bill your insurance company for the administration of the vaccine dose, but you will not be required to pay any money out of pocket for the vaccine. Employers I have staff that I believe qualify as healthcare and medical first responders in Phase 1a, how do I get them vaccinated?  Vaccine Types  There are differences between the vaccine types, but all three vaccines currently authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are highly effective based on trials. If you are 16 or 17 years old, the Pfizer vaccine is currently the only FDA authorized vaccine you can receive.  In general, given scarce supply, only one vaccine may be available through your provider. You can talk with your medical provider if you have specific questions or concerns that may lead you to want to seek out one specific COVID-19 vaccine versus another.   If you are 16 or 17 years old, you may only receive the Pfizer vaccine. Can I choose the vaccine that says it’s the most effective? All three vaccines are safe and highly effective against illness and death from COVID-19. Getting the vaccine as soon as you’re eligible, regardless of the brand, will protect you from severe illness, hospitalization and the risk of death from COVID-19.  The bottom line is the best shot you can get is the one that’s available. What is the difference between an mRNA and a viral vector vaccine? Both mRNA and viral vector vaccines contain instructions that teach our cells how to create ""spike proteins"", which is the protein found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. Once your cells produces COVID-19 spike proteins, your immune system recognizes that those proteins don’t belong in your body and creates antibodies to stop the virus from spreading and causing damage when you are exposed to it. Neither vaccine contains the  virus that causes COVID-19. The instructions in the mRNA vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA), the genetic material that tells your cells how to make proteins. The mRNA is surrounded by a tiny lipids (fatty molecules) which help mRNA enter directly into your cells. Once your cells create the spike proteins, your body breaks down the mRNA. In viral vector vaccines, spike protein DNA is placed inside a modified version of a different virus that doesn’t cause illness. This non-harmful virus delivers the DNA instructions to your cells – this virus is called the vector. Can I choose to get a one-dose vaccine? I don’t have time for two shots. You can receive the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it is available at the location you make your initial vaccine appointment. Availability of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will vary by location. The CDC and public health experts advise that everyone get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they become eligible, regardless of the manufacturer. Which vaccines are available to children under 18 years old? Pfizer’s vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine currently authorized for ages 16 and up. When booking a vaccine appointment for a 16 or 17 year old, be sure to confirm with the vaccine provider that Pfizer will be available.  The Second Dose (Pfizer & Moderna) Most providers will ask you to schedule your first and second vaccination at the same time and will help you set up reminders via text, email, or phone call about your second dose.   Do I have to get my second dose at the same location I got my first dose?  No, you are not required to get your second dose at the same location that you received your first dose. However, it’s encouraged that you receive both doses at the same location so your provider can ensure you’re getting the same vaccine type at the correct time.  Additionally, second doses are automatically accounted for and sent to the location where your first shot occurred, so you are “guaranteed” your second shot at that location.  Switching locations may delay the timing of your second shot appointment. What if I miss my second shot, or cannot find an appointment for 21 (for Pfizer)or 28 (for Moderna) days after my first shot - is it a problem if I wait? No. You do not need to get your second dose exactly 21 (for Pfizer) or 28 (for Moderna) days after your first shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have advised that the second should be taken up to 42 days of the first dose.  However, the CDC has also indicated that you do not need to start the shots over again if you go beyond the 42 day window for the second shot.  It will still be effective. Vaccine Trials How do we know the vaccines are safe?   The Pfizer vaccine alone had a trial of over 40,000 people over a period of many months without any serious incidents. No vaccines will be available to the public without the review of the federal government and the Science Subcommittee of Governor Lamont’s Vaccine Advisory Group. In Connecticut, we continue to make every decision with public health as a number one priority.   Since the vaccine is so new, how do you know there won’t be long term health effects from taking it? Because all COVID-19 vaccines are new, it will take more time and more people getting vaccinates to learn about very rare or possible long-term effects.  At least 8 weeks’ worth of safety data were gathered in the clinical trials for all the authorized vaccines and it’s unusual for vaccine side effects to appear more than 8 weeks after vaccination.  Have the vaccines been tested in children or teens? The Pfizer vaccine clinical trials and testing included participants 16 years and older. Pfizer and Moderna are currently conducting additional clinical trials in children and teens 12 years and older. Long-Term Care Facilities  You should continue to follow guidelines released by the Department of Public Health. While you or your family member may be vaccinated, you may come into others who are not, so it is critical to continue to use caution.  If I’m vaccinated, can I visit family in the hospital or nursing home?  You should continue to follow guidelines released by the Department of Public Health. While you or your family member may be vaccinated, you may come into others who are not, so it is critical to continue to use caution.  Once I’m vaccinated, can I stop wearing a mask and social distancing?  No. Not everyone you come into contact with will have received the vaccine, and you may still be able to spread COVID-19. It is critical to follow basic public health best practices for the foreseeable future.  Safety and Vaccine Risks   It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it’s possible you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. However, if you still get infected after you get vaccinated, the vaccine may prevent serious illness. What are the side effects of the vaccine?  Those who receive the vaccine may experience mild symptoms of COVID-19 and soreness at the site of injection. Information about rare allergic reactions to the vaccination can be found on the CDC website.  Is it safe to get vaccinated if I have an underlying health condition?  Yes. COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity.  People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. It is recommended that people with these conditions get vaccinated. Individuals who have had prior allergic reactions to injectable medicines should consult with their medical providers before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.   I’ve had allergic reactions to other shots, can I get the COVID-19 vaccine?  You should talk with your provider about what allergies may make it risky for you to get the COVID-19 vaccination, but, it has proven safe in the vast majority of instances.   Can I get the vaccine if I’m pregnant or nursing? Yes.   Can people who have already have COVID-19 get the vaccine?  Yes. The CDC recommends that you get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID-19 because you can catch it more than once. While you may have some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don’t know how long this protection will last.  How do we know the vaccines are safe?  The Pfizer vaccine alone had a trial of over 40,000 people over a period of many months without any serious incidents. No vaccines will be available to the public without the review of the federal government and the Science Subcommittee of Governor Lamont’s Vaccine Advisory Group. In Connecticut, we continue to make every decision with public health as a number one priority.   Are the vaccines safe for children? The Pfizer vaccine was proven safe and effective in participants 16 years of age and older during clinical studies. The Pfizer vaccine is currently the only vaccine approved by the FDA for use in individuals under 18 years of age. Pfizer and Moderna are currently conducting additional clinical trials to determine safety and effectiveness in teens and kids. Are individuals 16 and 17 year old at higher risk of side effects from the vaccine? The FDA determined that the Pfizer vaccine has a similar safety and effectiveness profile in 16 and 17 year old individuals as other aduits in clinical trials. Can the vaccine give me COVID-19?  No.  None of the COVD-19 vaccines currently authorized for use or in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID-19. However, it typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it’s possible you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick.  Does this vaccine cause infertility?  No. This is a rumor.  I have a food allergy, can I get the vaccine?

Information for Georgia Residents COVID-19 vaccines have passed rigorous reviews and are highly effective. ​ Scientists had a significant head start developing the COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 is very similar to other viruses, which already have vaccines. Testing was thorough and successful. All COVID-19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people to make sure they meet safety standards and protect adults of different races, ethnicities, and ages, including adults over the age of 65. There is no COVID-19 virus in the vaccine. The vaccine imitates the infection so that our bodies create antibody defenses to fight off COVID-19. Side effects are mild, temporary, and normal signs that your body is building protection. You may experience pain and swelling in the arm of the injection. Throughout the rest of your body, you may experience fever, chills, tiredness, and headaches.

Hawaii’s Vaccination Plan Hawai‘i submitted its vaccination plan to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on October 16, 2020. The initial draft document has been updated with changes based on new guidance on vaccine allocation and prioritization from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued in December 2020. An executive summary of the updated plan provides details on the robust operational structure and framework for the vaccination plan to reach high-risk groups as quickly and efficiently as possible. Click here to read the executive summary of the vaccination plan. Who will get the first vaccines? There are two major phases in the vaccination plan. The first phase is now underway to protect the three priority groups, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The three groups in this first phase include: Healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents, which is estimated to be 6% of Hawaii’s total population; Frontline essential workers and adults 75 years of age and older, which is about 20% of Hawaii’s population; and Adults age 65 to 74 years, persons 16 to 64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and essential workers not included in the other categories, which is 47% of the state’s population. Phase 2 will cover the rest of the population, which includes all persons 16 years and older who are not in the other categories. Phase 2 is projected to begin in early summer 2021, depending on production and federal allocation of doses through Operation Warp Speed. Based on the estimated number of people in each of these priority groups, 73% of Hawaii’s population will receive the vaccination if all those in phase 1 receive the vaccine. Phase 2 will cover the remaining 27% of Hawaii’s population.  Privacy Policy - Terms of Use call GoHawaii at 1-800-464-2924 to local services like health resources,"

COVID-19 vaccines are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they are shown to be safe and effective in reducing your chances of getting COVID-19. Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination will be an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are difficult to maintain for long periods of time. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed.

showing people of color die of COVID-19 at younger ages, Illinois lowered the age eligibility recommended by ACIP by 10 years, from age 75 to age 65. Illinois has 1.3 million people who qualify as “frontline essential workers” and 1.9 million adults age 65 and over, totaling 3.2 million eligible Illinoisans.

Easy access to COVID-19 vaccines is equally important. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with public health departments, health care providers, and other partners to make sure people can easily get a COVID-19 vaccine and that cost is not a barrier. Within Illinois, the CDC recognizes the state and the city of Chicago as separate jurisdictions for the distribution of vaccine. Both Illinois and Chicago, however, are collaborating to ensure that vaccines are delivered and available in accordance with the CDC guidelines and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Vaccine availability Q. When can I get a COVID-19 vaccine? A. The first supply of COVID-19 vaccine receiving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began being distributed in the U.S. on December 14, 2020.  During the initial period, referred to as Phase 1a, health care personnel and long-term care (LTC) residents and staff were eligible to be vaccinated.  The state as a whole moved to Phase 1b on January 25, 2021 once Phase 1a was substantially completed. The state will move to an expanded 1b on February 25, 2021. We expect vaccine supply to increase over time.  (To view the categories of priority populations in Phase 1a and Phase 1b, please see the chart below.)  Q. Where can I get the vaccine? A. If you are an eligible individual as outlined in Phase 1a or 1b (starting February 25), such as health care workers, first responders, essential workers, or anyone 65 years of age and older, you can find your nearest vaccination site here. Q. Will the state (or federal government) establish mass immunization programs, like they did in the 1960’s? A. Illinois is working with local health departments and providers across the state to provide COVID-19 vaccinations that resemble larger versions of yearly flu clinics, rather than the mass vaccination activities of the past. Q. Will undocumented people be able to get the vaccine? A. All populations in Illinois, including individuals who are undocumented, can receive the vaccine.  No one will be turned away when it is their time to be vaccinated.  Q. My family member was offered a vaccine through their employer. Why can’t the rest of my family get the vaccine? A. Because vaccine will be very limited when it first comes out, administration will be limited to those identified in prioritized (high-risk) groups by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the CDC. This is to ensure that all individuals in the high-risk groups are able to receive the vaccine. As more vaccine becomes available, those groups eligible to receive the vaccine will expand. Q. Is there a scheduled date for distribution per phases? A. There is not a scheduled calendar date, but once ACIP provides its recommendation on priority vaccination groups, IDPH will distribute vaccine to Regional Hospital Coordinating Centers (RHCC) partners throughout the state. From there, the distribution will continue ultimately through local health departments to local health care providers. Q. Will distribution of vaccine be divided per capita? A. Vaccine will be distributed according to the population of each county, adjusted to ensure health equity using the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Q. What about one municipality that has very high numbers of COVID-19 cases within a county that otherwise had less cases? (in reference to prioritizing vaccine distribution) A. Distribution within counties will be overseen by local health departments (LHD). IDPH will work with LHDs to ensure providers have adequate amounts of vaccine to support the municipalities/communities they serve. Q. Do the vaccines require more than one shot? A. The Johnson & Johnson Janseen vaccine only requires a single dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses, given weeks apart, to get the most protection. The first shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine starts building protection. A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer. The Pfizer-BioNTech doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart. Moderna doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart. You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. With the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine, protection against moderate to severe disease starts about two weeks after being vaccinated. Q. Which COVID-19 vaccine should I take? A. Any COVID-19 vaccine authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to be effective. Data available at this point would suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are very similar in their abilities to produce immunity to the virus; the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine was nearly 75% effective. The recommendation would be to take whatever vaccine is made available to you. Be sure to receive the booster shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at the appropriate time. If you choose not to get a second dose, you may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine only requires a single dose. Q. What happens if they run out of the vaccine before I get my second shot? A. CDC is structuring shipments in such a way that 21 or 28 days after the first shipment, the same number of doses will be shipped, so providers will have enough vaccine for a second dose. The 21- or 28-day requirement between doses is a minimum requirement, not a maximum. If, for some reason, you are unable to receive the second dose at the recommended interval, you can receive the second dose at a later date. Q. Besides health care workers, who will be able to administer the vaccine? A. Dentists, pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians have had their scope of practice extended by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to allow them to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. IDPH has authorized Emergency Medical Technicians – Intermediate (EMT-I) and Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians to administer the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines after successful completion of an IDPH approved vaccine training program. Vaccine Requirements/Mandates Q. Do I have to get a COVID-19 vaccine? A. There is no federal or state mandate to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC recommends the vaccine to all Americans 16 and over. Q. Can my employer require that I receive a COVID-19 vaccine before returning to work? A. Decisions regarding immunization at private workplaces are up to the employer. Q. Are schools requiring students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, similar to mumps and measles? Will restrictions be placed on my child if we refuse to vaccinate? A. There is no requirement for students to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at this time. Currently, a pediatric vaccine is not available, and it may be some time before one is approved and becomes available. Q. What happens if I refuse to get vaccinated? A. There are no legal repercussions (such as fines, sanctions or punishments) for refusing the vaccine. If you do not get vaccinated, you will not be protected against the virus that causes COVID-19 and will be more likely to be infected with the virus. Additionally, you will be at risk of transmitting this deadly virus to loved ones and other community members. Q. Do I need a vaccine if I have already had COVID-19? A. Yes, people who have already had COVID-19 should plan to take the COVID-19 vaccine, because the science is currently inconclusive as to whether you will be naturally protected from a second COVID-19 infection in the future. The CDC currently suggests that if you were infected with COVID-19 during the previous 90 days, it is likely that you still have immune protection and that you will be asked to wait to receive your vaccine to allow others to be vaccinated first. Q. Do I have to get both the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine? A. A seasonal flu vaccine will not protect you from COVID-19. Being infected with both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time could lead to a more severe illness, which is why it is more important now than ever to get the flu vaccine. Vaccine Safety Q. Is a COVID-19 vaccine safe? A. The U.S. vaccine safety system is a deliberate and multi-phase process to ensure all vaccines are as safe as possible. Safety is a top priority. Vaccine candidates conduct clinical trials with many thousands of study participants to generate scientific data and other information for the FDA to determine their safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines a vaccine meets its safety and effectiveness standards, it can make these vaccines available for use in the U.S. by approval or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). After the FDA makes its determination, ACIP will review the available data in order to make vaccine recommendations to the CDC. ACIP will then recommend vaccine use. After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, vaccine safety monitoring systems will watch for adverse events (possible side effects). CDC is working to expand safety surveillance through new systems and additional information sources, as well as enhancing existing safety monitoring systems. Q: How was the COVID-19 vaccine studied? A: Each authorized COVID-19 vaccine has been studied in large trials of over 30,000 volunteers and shown to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19 disease. The trials involved people of different ages, sex, race/ethnicity, weight, and medical conditions. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems were excluded from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, and so the currently available studies do not provide direct information about vaccine safety and effectiveness in these groups of people. The CDC recommends that those who are pregnant consult with their doctor before taking the vaccine. Q. Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause me to become infected or infect others? A. No, you cannot become infected or infect others from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, because the vaccine contains no live virus. Instead, the vaccine directs your body to produce a protein that teaches your body how to fight off the virus. Q. How long will it take for COVID-19 vaccines to take effect? A. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are expected to provide some protection a couple of weeks after your first shot and reaches its greatest effectiveness after your second shot. It is very important to take the second shot within the recommended time period for maximum vaccine effectiveness. The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine is effective 14 days after vaccination. Q. What have the trials revealed? A. Through their respective clinical trials, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have indicated their vaccines are approximately 95% effective. The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine was found to be more than 74% effective (74.4%). Information gathered through clinical trials becomes public in the course of the EUA submission. Once the EUA is submitted, these documents become accessible by the public through the FDA. Q. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I am pregnant? A. COVID-19 vaccines should be administered to pregnant individuals who choose to be vaccinated. Pregnant individuals can receive a COVID-19 vaccine in any setting authorized to administer these vaccines, including any clinical setting and nonclinical community-based vaccination sites, such as schools, community centers, and other mass vaccination locations. If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talking with a health care provider may help you make an informed decision. While a conversation with a health care provider may be helpful, it is not required prior to vaccination. Q. Can children get a COVID-19 vaccine? A. Currently, a pediatric vaccine is not available, and it may be some time before one is approved and becomes available. Clinical trials need to be conducted with children before determining if the existing COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for them. Q. Will youth with high risk conditions be included in any of the phases? A. The availability of a vaccine for youth, under the age of 16 years, will depend on the availability of a pediatric vaccine. Clinical trials need to be conducted with children before determining if the existing COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for them. Q. Can the COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID-19? A. No. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick. The vaccine teaches our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. Q. After getting a flu shot, I always get the flu. Will this cause me to get COVID-19? A. No, you cannot become infected, or infect others, from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, because the vaccine contains no live virus. Instead, the vaccine directs your body to produce a protein that teaches your body how to fight off the virus. Some people develop flu-like symptoms, such as mild fever and muscle aches, after getting a flu vaccination. These symptoms are not the same as having influenza. Q. I have allergies. Is this vaccine safe for me? A. While serious allergic reactions were not seen in vaccine clinical trials of thousands of patients, rare allergic reactions to vaccines are possible. If you have a history of serious allergic reactions, you should discuss your situation with your healthcare provider. The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any animal products such as eggs. Q. What are the side effects of this vaccine? A. Some people may experience side effects, which are a part of the normal immune response to a vaccine. The majority of the side effects, while not seen in every individual, are signs that your body is recognizing the vaccine and mounting an immune response. Based on prior studies, side effects may include pain, redness and swelling at the site of the injection., fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, malaise, and swollen lymph nodes. These symptoms may occur within 2 days after the shot and last 1 to 2 days. Side effects may be more frequent after the 2nd shot (booster) and less frequent among older adults Long-term side effects are unknown, although most vaccines do not have long-term side effects. Vaccine studies are ongoing and will continue to monitor and watch for adverse events. Q. It took four years to develop the mumps vaccine, how can the COVID-19 vaccine be safe and thoroughly tested so quickly? A. Many things helped this vaccine get developed so rapidly. Significant resources were invested to fund the basic research and clinical trials, accelerating timelines greatly. Joining existing trial sites instead of developing new sites was a time saver. The virus has a good vaccination target and relatively low mutation rate. Additionally, the amount of infection in the communities allowed scientists to quickly compare vaccinated to unvaccinated populations and conclusively shows the vaccine worked. Last, but not least, are the huge number of brave volunteers willing to try the “novel” vaccines during the clinical trials. Q. How long will the vaccine protect me from COVID-19? Will this be an annual vaccination, like the flu? A. We are still learning about length of immunity. To determine how long protection lasts, follow-up studies are required to detect levels of both types of immune responses – antibody and T cell – as well as any repeated exposure risks. As more information becomes available, more information will be shared on the length of immunity. Q. Can I get COVID-19 after the first dose of the vaccine? A. Although the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine offers some immunity, you will still be considered susceptible to COVID-19. The first dose of the vaccine will provide some protection, but the recommendation is to receive two doses to be protected as intended. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have indicated that after the two doses their vaccines are approximately 95% effective. The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine only requires a single dose and is more than 74% effective after 14 days. Q. All the research indicates that I am at high risk for contracting COVID-19, yet I am not considered eligible for the vaccine. How is that fair? A. The vaccine manufacturers, CDC, and the state are all committed to getting the vaccine to everyone as soon as possible. ACIP is a group of medical and public health experts that develop recommendations on how to use vaccines to control diseases in the U.S. ACIP decides on vaccine prioritization recommendations by reviewing the FDA information, clinical trial data, and other information. Initially, the limited supply of vaccine will only be available to those determined to be most at risk of exposure to COVID-19. As the vaccine supply increases, more people will be added to those prioritized until it is available to the adult population at large. Q. Is this vaccine preservative free? A. Yes. The vaccines currently offered are preservative free. Other Q. Will a COVID-19 vaccination protect me from getting sick with COVID-19? A. Yes. COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19. The first two vaccines approved for use in the U.S. – one by Pfizer-BioNTech, the other by Moderna – are known as mRNA vaccines and contain material from the COVID-19 virus that gives our cells instructions to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the COVID-19 virus if we are infected in the future. The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine employs a common cold virus genetically engineered to infect cells and deliver genetic instructions to stimulate an overwhelming immune response. The vaccine uses the cold virus (called adenovirus type 26) to deliver a piece of genetic material (DNA) to make the distinctive “spike” protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. The altered cold virus enters cells and follows the genetic instructions to replicate the coronavirus spike. The body’s immune system can then use these replicas to recognize and to react defensively, triggering an immune response against the actual COVID-19 virus. Q. I would like to know how we plan to roll out an educational campaign for vaccine. A. Along with educational and communications campaigns from the federal government, the state will use multiple traditional, social, and community media platforms to communicate across Illinois. Providers, statewide, will be educated in the particular vaccine products after EUA approval, but before administering vaccine. Q. How many people need to get vaccinated to have herd immunity to COVID-19? A. The percentage of people who need to have protection in order to achieve herd immunity varies by disease. Scientists estimate that to control COVID-19 and reach herd immunity, about 7 or 8 of every 10 people (75%-80%) will need to be immune. Q. What are the vaccine recommendations for children under age 16? A. Until more studies are completed, a vaccine for children under 16 is not expected to be available in the immediate future. Q. The vaccine is now available, when will we move to Phase 5 of the Restore Illinois plan? If not now, what is required to get to Phase 5? A. At this time, we are not able to immediately move to Phase 5. The vaccine and/or a highly effective treatment needs to be widely available, and new cases need to be eliminated for a sustained period of time, before we can move to Phase 5 or we risk the possibility of increased cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Q. If I get the vaccine, can I quit wearing a mask? A. No. While the COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective, it is not 100% effective. Until the COVID-19 pandemic is controlled, people who receive the vaccine need to continue following Illinois Department of Public Health guidance, such as the use of face masks, social distancing, regular hand washing, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. Even after vaccination you can be an asymptomatic carrier of the COVID-19 virus and possibly infect others. Q: Can I get more than one vaccine? A: No. Current CDC guidance states that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are not interchangeable. You should not get more than one type of coronavirus vaccine, and you should not mix the two-dose vaccines. Q: Is it possible to compare the effectiveness of the three COVID-19 vaccines? A: No. The only way to accurately compare the effectiveness of vaccines is by direct comparison in head-to-head clinical trials, which did not occur for these vaccines. Furthermore, the clinical trials for these vaccines occurred in different geographic regions and at different points in time with varying incidence of COVID-19. Q: When will masking and social distancing be able to end, allowing us to get back to normal life? A: Given the time it takes to get large quantities of the vaccine produced and distributed, we will need to continue our current mitigation practices for some time. It will remain important that vaccinated people continue to wear masks, practice social distancing and good hand hygiene to help prevent spread. Community infection rates will be continuously monitored and will be used to guide the decision process. Q. Who is paying for the COVID-19 vaccines? A. The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States. Q. Can the State purchase more vaccine? A. No. The federal government oversees the allocation of vaccine to states. Q. How much will this vaccine cost me? Is it covered by my insurance? A. There is no cost for the vaccine. However, vaccination providers can charge an administration fee for giving the shot that is reimbursed by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. No one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay a vaccine administration fee. Q. Will the administrative fees be passed on to the patient in the form of a co-pay or deductible? A. No. Q. Will the manufacturing workers who were deemed essential also be in the first round? A. Individuals who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and frontline workers with higher risk of exposure because of their inability to perform work duties remotely and proximity to other co-workers or members of the public are included in Phase 1b. What are the priority groups? The current priority groups that have been released, based on the guidance of ACIP, are as follows: Phase 1a Priority Groups Health care workers, as well as residents and personnel in long-term congregate care facilities where high rates of transmission and outbreaks can occur. Health care personnel Hospital settings Medical outpatient clinics Local Health Department Points of Distribution (PODs) Home health care workers Medical outpatient clinics Public health clinics Local Health Department Points of Distribution (PODs) Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) Home health care workers Home health aides Long-term care facility staff and all residents Skilled Nursing Facilities Assisted Living Facilities Intermediate Care Facilities for Persons with Developmental Disabilities Intermediate Care Facilities for Persons with Severe Mental Illness State-run Veterans’ Homes State-operated Centers for Persons with Developmental Disabilities State-operated Mental Health Centers Residential Treatment Centers for Substance Abuse Other identified congregate care staff and all residents Continuing Care Residential Facilities Residential Care Adult Homes Supportive Housing for Seniors Supportive Residential Facilities for Persons with Developmental Disabilities Supportive Residential Facilities for Persons with Severe Mental Illness Community Integrated Living Arrangements Supervised Residential Facilities for Persons with Developmental Disabilities Supervised Residential Facilities for Persons with Severe Mental Illness Phase 1b Priority Groups Persons who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and frontline workers with higher risk of exposure due to their inability to work remotely and proximity to coworkers or the public. Age 65 or older Frontline essential worker (Below are examples of frontline workers within the eligible categories for Phase 1b) First responders Fire, law enforcement, 911 worker, security personnel, school officer Education K-12 teacher, school administrator, student support staff, student aide, day care worker and center-based child care provider, home visiting provider, early intervention therapists, Head Start/Early Head Start provider, Preschool for All provider Food and agriculture Processing plants, veterinary health, livestock services, animal care Manufacturing Industrial production of goods for distribution to retail, wholesale, or other manufacturers Corrections workers and incarcerated individuals Correctional officer and staff, jail officer and staff, juvenile facility staff, a worker providing in-person support or services, incarcerated individuals U. S. Postal Service worker Public transit worker Flight crew, bus driver, train conductor, taxi driver, para-transit driver, in-person support, ride sharing service driver Grocery store worker Bagger, cashier, stocker, pickup, customer service Shelters and adult day care staff Homeless shelter, women’s shelter, adult day/drop-in program, sheltered workshop Phase 1b Plus Priority Groups Persons with specific health-complicating conditions or status. Eligible Conditions Obesity Diabetes Pulmonary Diseases Smoking Heart Conditions Chronic Kidney Disease Cancer Solid Organ Transplant Sickle Cell Disease Pregnancy Persons with a Disability (Not otherwise covered in previous categories.) After adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates by age, the CDC found that Hispanic and Black Americans were dying at a rate of almost 3 times that of White Americans. In Illinois, the average age of COVID-19 death is 81 for white residents, 72 for Black residents and 68 for Latino residents. While the highest count of COVID-19 deaths is among those 75 years and older, minority populations are dying at younger ages.  Given those facts, vaccine is being made available to those age 65 and older. Additional information on confirmed and potential priority groups can be found here: Health care personnel continue to be on the front line of the nation’s fight against this deadly pandemic. By providing critical care to those infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, many health care personnel are at high risk of being exposed to and getting sick with COVID-19. Health care personnel who get COVID-19 can also spread the virus to patients seeking care for other medical conditions that, in turn, increase patients’ risk for severe COVID-19 illness. Early vaccine access is critical to ensuring the health and safety of this essential workforce of approximately 21 million people across the USA, protecting not only them but also their patients, communities, and the broader health of our country. People with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, regardless of their age. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or that they are at increased risk of dying. Early vaccine access is essential to ensuring the health and safety of this population that is disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Among adults, the risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults considered to be at the highest risk. Early vaccine access is vital to help protect this population that has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Workers in essential and critical industries are considered part of America’s critical infrastructure, as defined by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency. Current data show that many of these workers are at increased risk for getting COVID-19. Early vaccine access is to protect them in order to maintain the essential services they provide U.S. communities. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-02-Dooling.pdf COVID-19 Home Places of Worship Guidance School GuidanceAddressing COVID-19 in Schools School Guidance FAQs Children & Pregnant Women Guidance Sports Safety Guidance Long Term Care Testing Requirements Outdoor Visitation Guidance Oral and Dental Care Guidance Workplace Rights and Safety Places of Worship Guidance Quarantine Guidance Child Face Coverings in Schools Addressing COVID-19 in Schools Child Face Coverings in Schools School Guidance FAQs Daycare Guidance Children & Pregnant Women Guidance EMS & First Responder Guidance Sports Safety Guidance Long Term Care Testing Requirements Outdoor Visitation Guidance Essential Caregiver Guidance Long Term Care Testing Requirements Long-Term Care Antigen Testing Outdoor Visitation Guidance PPE Guidance in LTC Facilities Oral and Dental Care Guidance Statewide Metrics Outbreak Locations School Outbreaks County Level Risk MetricsCounty & School Metrics Syndromic Surveillance Data Portal Variants Regional COVID-19 Metrics Statewide Metrics Outbreak Locations School Outbreaks Contact Tracing Data Outbreak Locations Potential Exposure Location School Outbreaks Schools Potential Exposures County & School Metrics Hospitalization Utilization Syndromic Surveillance LTC Facility Outbreaks Data Portal Testing Statistics Variants Mobile Testing Sites Frequently Asked Questions Public Communication Treatment Information Frequently Asked Questions Donation of Convalescent Plasma Public Communication COVID-19 Ambassadors Lab and Testing Procedures Routine Oral and Dental Care Vaccine Provider Instructions Elective Surgical Procedure Guidance Lab and Testing Procedures Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Routine Oral and Dental Care Testing Recommendations Vaccine Provider Instructions External & Translated Resources COVID-19 Press Briefings External & Translated Resources Governor Pritzker's Executive Orders and Rules Vaccine Data Vaccine Distribution Vaccination Planning Guide Vaccine Data Vaccine Allocations Vaccine Distribution Resources VaxText Second Dose Reminder Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Letter Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Factsheet for Healthcare Providers Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 EUA Factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers Moderna Emergency Use Authorization Moderna Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet Moderna Patient Fact Sheet Pfizer Emergency Use Authorization Pfizer Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet Pfizer Patient Fact Sheet ACIP Slide Deck for vote on Pfizer COVID vaccine V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker Usability Accessibility Resources Advisory Boards Office of the Inspector General Centers for Disease Control Office of Governor JB Pritzker Illinois Jobs Illinois.gov home page Employment Opportunities List of Local Health Departments National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Quick links File a Health Care Complaint  Diseases A-Z List FOIA Requests Health Data IDPH Calendar Laws & Rules Forms & Publications Grant Accountability and Transparency (GATA) TRENDING TOPICS @IDPH #WearAMask  when you are in a restaurant, particularly indoors & when speaking with restaurant workers and servers.… https://t.co/L4t2ahDoJH Public Health Officials Announce 3,790 New Cases of Coronavirus Disease: https://t.co/ZL5GN2oOn4 Visit our twitter page © 2021 Illinois Department of Public Health.

Vaccine Safety Vaccine Scheduling and Registration Vaccine Administration Schedule Second Dose Other Vaccine Questions About the vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and additional vaccines are being developed by other manufacturers. The EUA process has allowed for clinical trials and manufacturing to occur simultaneously, while still allowing for rigorous testing to determine how safe and effective it is. The first goal is to focus on the safety of the vaccine and determining how effective it is. Before any vaccine is released, it must first complete three phases of clinical trials to study its effect on thousands of diverse study participants. Once that study is done, the pharmaceutical company submits the results for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. FDA. This is a way to make important health breakthroughs available to the public quickly. The next step before the vaccine is available is for the Indiana Department of Health’s Vaccine Allocation Plan Development Advisory Group to make final recommendations on the ethical and equitable allocation of a limited COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines by Pfizer (click here for Spanish version), Moderna (click here for Spanish version) and Johnson & Johnson (click here for Spanish version) are now available. Some groups will be recommended to get a COVID-19 vaccine first. We have set up a phased-in approach to determine who is eligible for vaccine first based on the most effective way to reduce the impact of COVID-19. The Pfizer vaccine is not initially available for children under age 16 or younger than age 18 for Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Early clinical trials of the vaccine show no adverse effects for pregnant women, but if you’re pregnant, you should have a conversation with a healthcare provider to see if it’s right for you.

The goal was to get input from a variety of experts in a number of areas, including infectious disease, hospitals and health care, education, faith-based communities, pharmacies, organizations serving minorities and those with disabilities, local health departments and others. Vaccine Allocation Plan Development Advisory Group: Provided final recommendations on the ethical and equitable allocation of a limited COVID-19 vaccine. This group remains available to assemble as adjustments to the plan are needed as we learn how much vaccine we will receive and review the research about how safe and effective the vaccine is. Ethical Considerations Advisory Group: Reviewed existing documents and assisted in writing and reviewing ethical approaches to vaccine allocation. This group founded its recommendations with the goals to decrease overall deaths, reduce the spread of COVID-19, make sure limited resources are used responsibly, and support healthcare systems to ensure that they have the resources needed to administer vaccine, treat disease and protect vulnerable populations in a fair, equitable manner. Vaccine Review Advisory Group: This group will investigate available information on each COVID-19 vaccine and will specifically review the safety profile and efficacy of each population of interest (those at clinical risk and demographic factors). Equitable Distribution and Communication Advisory Group: Worked to ensure that all Hoosiers were considered and represented as a component of the vaccine allocation plan. Advised on key components of communication. Data Advisory Group: Explored creative data resources and compiled Indiana-specific data for critical populations. Vaccination Program Implementation Committee: External committee facilitated by the Indiana Department of Health’s (IDOH) State Health Commissioner with representation from state and local government organizations, private sectors, tribes, healthcare, education, and critical infrastructure.

COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 7,600 Louisianans died from COVID in 2020 — that’s more than the number of deaths caused by accidents, stroke and diabetes combined in Louisiana in 2017. The vaccines are critical to ending the pandemic and getting our lives back to normal. Who is eligible for the vaccines? Everyone in Louisiana ages 16 and older is eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Having a large portion of the population vaccinated is our best shot at a return to some form of normalcy. Based on conversations with our federal partners, we are encouraged that Louisiana will receive enough doses to vaccinate everyone who wants a shot.  Where can I get a vaccine? All nine public health regions and 64 parishes of the state have at least one vaccine location. To find one near you, visit covidvaccine.la.gov and click/tap on the Vaccine Locations button. Vaccines are available at select: Chain pharmacies Grocery stores Retail stores Independent pharmacies Hospitals Public health providers Urgent cares Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) Community events Medical practices Rural health clinics (RHCs) Other healthcare providers In addition to these providers, community vaccination events are taking place across the state and are listed at covidvaccine.la.gov.  I have heard that i might need to get more than one shot to be vaccinated. Is this true? Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are in two doses, administered 3 or 4 weeks apart. You will get the necessary information about the second dose when you get your initial vaccine. The second dose is very important. One dose will not provide long-term protection. People vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine will receive the second dose 21 days after the first dose. Those getting the Moderna vaccine will receive the second dose 28 days after the first dose. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given in one dose. We know many people actually prefer a one-and-done vaccine, like young people, people who are afraid of needles, and people who work multiple jobs or have difficulty taking time off work. This single dose also may offer more protection faster than the other two vaccines. Will I still need to wear a mask and practice social distancing? It depends on the circumstance. The CDC now advises that if you are fully vaccinated (14+ days out from completing your vaccine series), you do not need to mask and distance if: You are in a private home exclusively with others who are also fully vaccinated. You are spending time with ONE additional family unit who is not fully vaccinated, and none of them have underlying health conditions placing them at high risk for complications if they become infected with COVID. Beyond these settings, and anytime you are in public, masking and distancing are still necessary. Masks are especially important due to the COVID variants circulating in the U.S. The CDC now says tight-fitting is better than loose, multiple layers are better and two masks are better. New data is emerging daily and the CDC is constantly reevaluating its recommendations. We expect masking and distancing to go away soon, particularly for those who are vaccinated. But for now, except for the two examples above, they are still important and recommended. Will I still need to quarantine if I am exposed to someone who is infected with COVID-19? People who have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus (two doses of either Pfizer or Moderna, or one dose of J&J) do not have to quarantine if they are exposed to someone infected with the virus. However, they should still take precautions such as wearing a mask and practicing social distancing. For people who live in congregate settings such as nursing homes, the Department of Health still recommends quarantine for anyone who has been exposed. How much will it cost to get vaccinated? The federal government is making vaccines available at no cost to the individual. You do NOT need insurance to get the vaccine. If you do have insurance it may be billed but the vaccine will be no cost to YOU. Can the vaccines affect my fertility? There is zero evidence that COVID vaccines affect fertility. The vaccines tell the body how to fight the protein that is on the outside of the coronavirus, but this protein is completely different from the protein that allows for successful reproduction. The antibodies your body produces to fight the coronavirus will not attack reproductive proteins. How do the vaccines work? Unlike many vaccines, the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines do not contain a dead or a weakened virus that triggers an immune response. Instead, these vaccines contain a genetic instruction manual that tells your immune system how to respond and protect you from exposure to the actual virus. The technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is not new. It is called mRNA, or messenger RNA, and it has been around for decades. This is the first time mRNA has been used in a vaccine, but the effect is the same as other vaccines: Your body gets protection without the serious consequences of a severe illness due to COVID-19 exposure. The J&J vaccine works like many vaccines you are already familiar with. It uses an adenovirus vector, (in this case, a harmless cold virus) that carries the blueprint for the spike proteins on the virus’s surface. This virus works like a Trojan horse, infecting cells and replicating the coronavirus spikes. If you later become infected with the coronavirus, these replicated spikes are how your immune system recognizes and knows how to fight the real thing. Are the vaccines effective? Are the vaccines safe? What does FDA authorization mean? Vaccines are authorized for use by the FDA, meaning clinical trials have proven the vaccines as a safe and effective defense against COVID-19. The FDA and ACIP will continue to monitor safety and effectiveness data. No steps were skipped during the clinical trials and data review process for COVID-19 vaccines. Safety is a top priority. The COVID vaccines are being held to the same standards as other vaccines to make sure they are safe. Are the vaccines OK if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?  The CDC advises all pregnant people be given access to the vaccines. In Louisiana, anyone currently pregnant is currently eligible to be vaccinated. While specific studies are ongoing, there has been no indication that there are negative effects for this population. Pregnant and breastfeeding people should discuss whether they should receive their vaccine with their providers."

Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Vaccination is an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Two of the three vaccines, such as from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, use a genetic molecule known as mRNA to prime the immune system against COVID-19. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which stimulates the immune system. While the mRNA is destroyed by our cells within days, the immune protection from the vaccine may last for months or even years. What are the side effects? Can the vaccine give me COVID-19? How do I know the vaccine is safe? While it is possible that a small number of adverse effects occur following vaccination, the health risk from COVID-19 is far greater than potential complications from the vaccine. You should discuss any concerns with your health care provider to determine your best course of action. For more about the three approved COVID-19 vaccines, consult this U.S. CDC fact sheet. It is recommended that people get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they were previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. People who had COVID-19 can get the vaccine when eligible to receive it after they’ve recovered from being ill with COVID-19. Two of the currently authorized vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) require two doses. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The third currently authorized vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) requires a single dose. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving that dose. Yes. The vaccines are not interchangeable. People who get a vaccine that requires two doses must make sure they get the second dose from the same manufacturer as the first dose. This can vary by vaccine, and we will likely learn more about this over time. For the three currently authorized vaccines, individuals are considered fully vaccinated approximately 14 days after their final dose. For Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose. For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving one dose. The latest science indicates that fully vaccinated individuals are now able to safely socialize carefully with other fully vaccinated individuals in private settings without physical distancing and without wearing masks. In public places, it remains important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations for how to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. When can I stop wearing a mask and practicing physical distancing after I've been vaccinated? Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before making that decision. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision.

For uninsured people, any administrative fees charged by participating providers will be paid for by the federal Provider Relief Fund. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has published detailed factsheets on each approved COVID-19 vaccine, which are available in multiple languages. Please find them here: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine  COVID-19 vaccination can help keep you from getting COVID-19. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Vaccination is an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic.  Two of the three vaccines, such as from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, use a genetic molecule known as mRNA to prime the immune system against COVID-19. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which stimulates the immune system. While the mRNA is destroyed by our cells within days, the immune protection from the vaccine may last for months or even years. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does not use mRNA. Rather, it's what's known as an adenovirus vector vaccine. It uses the more established approach of employing a harmless cold virus to deliver a gene that carries the blueprint for the spiky protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. The injection into your arm won’t feel different than any other vaccine. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of COVID-19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer vaccine study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at least 25 percent to 33 percent of patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills minor swelling, pain at the injection site, and muscle pain. Side effects might affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. No, it cannot. The vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. do not include any version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  Each vaccine company’s application to the federal Food and Drug Administration included two months of follow-up safety data from clinical trials conducted by universities and other independent bodies, during which tens of thousands of volunteers got a vaccine and waited to see if they became infected, compared with others who received a placebo. By September, Pfizer’s trial had 44,000 participants; no serious safety concerns have been reported.  While it is possible that a small number of adverse effects occur following vaccination, the health risk from COVID-19 is far greater than potential complications from the vaccine. You should discuss any concerns with your health care provider to determine your best course of action. For more about the three approved COVID-19 vaccines, consult this U.S. CDC fact sheet.  consult this U.S. CDC fact sheet .  It is recommended that people get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they were previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. People who had COVID-19 can get the vaccine when eligible to receive it after they’ve recovered from being ill with COVID-19. Two of the currently authorized vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) require two doses. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The third currently authorized vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) requires a single dose. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving that dose. Yes. The vaccines are not interchangeable. People who get a vaccine that requires two doses must make sure they get the second dose from the same manufacturer as the first dose.   This can vary by vaccine, and we will likely learn more about this over time.

COVID-19 vaccine orders are available here Ensuring that, in time, every person across Maine, regardless of where they live, can get a COVID-19 vaccine is critically important to the Mills Administration. Unfortunately, right now, providing a COVID-19 vaccine is much more complicated than giving a flu shot. For example, one of the vaccines in use from Pfizer requires storage in ultra-cold freezers that only a limited number of health care facilities have. Once a vial of the Moderna vaccine is opened, all 10 doses in it must be provided within 6 hours to prevent wasting a single dose. Also, because some individuals experience side effects after receiving a dose, there must be 15 to 30 minutes of observation by a medical professional. Further, physical distance must be maintained at every stage of the process for safety. The reporting requirements, along with other rules for accountability, are greater than those for many other vaccines.

FAQs about COVID-19 What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness. What is the current COVID-19 situation in Maryland? Up-to-date information about testing and case counts in Maryland is available at coronavirus.maryland.gov​. The page is updated daily. On May 13, 2020, Governor Larry Hogan announced the ‘​Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery​,’ which lays out a path to the gradual and responsible reopening of Maryland’s economy while protecting public health. Marylanders are advised to heed all state and local public health guidance: All Marylanders who are older and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk for COVID-19 are advised to avoid crowds Employers should continue to encourage telework for their employees whenever possible Everyone should continue wearing masks or face coverings in public areas, businesses, and public transportation Marylanders should continue practicing physical distancing, staying six feet apart when possible On March 9, Gov. Hogan announced new actions to ease the COVID-19 mitigation measures that took effect on March 12: Capacity limits lifted on outdoor and indoor dining at restaurants and bars, retail businesses, religious facilities, fitness centers, casinos, personal services, and indoor recreational establishments. Bars and restaurants will be open for seated and distanced service only—patrons may not stand at a crowded bar. Read the order. Large outdoor and indoor venues may operate at 50% capacity. This includes theaters; concert, convention, and wedding venues; racing facilities, and outdoor entertainment and sporting venues. Medical adult day care centers may reopen, with facilities able to set appropriate restrictions and safety measures. Read the order. Quarantine requirements and other restrictions on out-of-state travel were lifted. The MDH travel advisory remains in place, and Marylanders continue to be encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 upon their return from out-of-state travel. Read the updated MDH directives. Information about the Hogan administration’s ongoing response to COVID-19 is available here​. What are risk factors for serious illness from COVID-19? Everyone is at risk for COVID-19. However, symptoms can range from mild to severe and may have different complications for each person. Older people, age 60 and above, and those with pre-existing medical conditions have a higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19. Examples of pre-existing medical conditions include cancer, diabetes, heart disease or other conditions impacting the immune system’s ability to fight germs. While older people and those with pre-existing conditions are at a higher risk, current ​MDH data shows that the majority of infections are in adults under 60​ years of age. People of all ages need to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. How does COVID-19 spread? COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes. COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people. For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Symptoms, or combinations of symptoms, that may appear 2-14 days after exposure include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea What is the difference between the flu and COVID-19? Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two. Signs and Symptoms: Both COVID-19 and the flu have common symptoms including chills, fever, cough, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, runny nose and fatigue. COVID-19 seems to cause more serious illnesses in some people. Other signs and symptoms of COVID-19, different from flu, may include change in or loss of taste or smell. When Symptoms Appear After Exposure: If a person has COVID-19, it could take them longer to develop symptoms than if they had flu. Typically, a person with the flu develops symptoms anywhere from 1 to 4 days after infection.  A person with COVID-19 may typically develop symptoms 5 days after being infected, but symptoms can appear between 2 and 14 days after infection. For more information, see the CDC ​Similarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19​. What do I need to know about the flu season during the COVID-19 pandemic? Getting a flu vaccine during the 2020-2021 influenza season is more important than ever because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Flu vaccination is especially important for adults 65 years and older, who account for most hospitalizations and deaths from flu and from COVID-19. Flu information and resources in Maryland: https://health.maryland.gov/flu​ Read more from the CDC: ​Protect Your Health This Flu Season​ ​Adults 65 & over are at higher risk for flu complications​ What should I do if I think I am sick with COVID-19? If you become sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact your health care provider, especially if you are over 60 years of age or have pre-existing medical conditions. If you do not have a health care provider, contact your local health department. Follow these steps: Call your health care provider, local health department or emergency room before you go Tell them about your symptoms, any recent travel and close contacts (such as people in your household) Wear a mask If someone has COVID-19, what will happen to them? The vast majority of people recover from this infection. Most people will have mild or moderate symptoms. Most people may be advised to recover at home and isolate themselves from others. These individuals should call their physicians or health care practitioners if their symptoms get worse. Some COVID-19 infections can lead to serious illness, and in some cases death. If someone has a more serious illness from COVID-19, they may be admitted to the hospital. Should I wear a face mask? All Marylanders over the age of 5 must wear a face covering while in indoor public areas, retail stores, outdoors when unable to maintain social distancing, and on public transportation. Face coverings should cover both your nose and your chin. Read the order here. Masks and face coverings can be made from household items and include wearing a scarf or bandanna that covers the nose and mouth. The CDC has detailed guidance and instructions regarding the use of masks available here. Masks and face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. People with disabilities who are unable to wear a mask are provided reasonable accommodations per the Americans with Disabilities Act. The masks and face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. The CDC has also advised that face coverings with ventilators should be avoided. Should I make plans to travel? Travel increases your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. The CDC recommends that you do not travel at this time. Postpone travel and stay home to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Some people should not travel. People who are sick, have recently tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, or have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 pose a very high risk to others during travel. If you must travel, take preventive measures to protect yourself and others, such as wearing a mask for the duration of your trip. Masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. All air passengers coming to the United States, including U.S. citizens, are required to have a negative COVID-19 test result or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 before boarding a flight to the United States. See the Frequently Asked Questions for more information. For additional travel resources and guidance, visit the CDC travel advisory site. What can I do to protect myself and others? Take preventive steps to slow the spread of COVID-19: Get vaccinated – All Marylanders age 16 and older can pre-register for an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination site Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, your sleeve or your elbow Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth Clean and disinfect​ ​frequently touched objects and surfaces using standard cleaning practices Practice social distancing — keep distance between yourself and others and avoid crowds Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others Avoid close contact with people who are sick If you are sick, stay home, except when seeking medical care What is social distancing? The best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 is through “social distancing,” which means avoiding close contact with others. Social distancing can take many forms, depending on your lifestyle and your family or living situation. Social distancing can include the following habits and steps: Avoid handshaking, hugging and other intimate types of greeting Stay at least six feet away from others whenever possible, and wear a mask Avoid non-essential travel (your health care provider may have specific guidance for your situation) Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces Work from home if possible, for your work situation Avoid unnecessary errands — consider ways to have essential items, like food and other household supplies, brought to you through delivery services or through family or social networks It is recommended that those at a high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 stay home as much as possible and contact their health care provider. While social distancing and self-quarantine are needed to limit and control the spread of the disease, social connectedness is important. Virtual resources can and should be used during this time. Talk to your friends and family on the phone or over video to stay connected. Are there vaccines available to prevent COVID-19? There are authorized and recommended vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Vaccines help protect against serious illness from COVID-19. Maryland will distribute the vaccines to seven different priority groups based on the relative risk of exposure or developing a serious illness. Learn more: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQs about the Maryland COVID-19 Vaccination Plan and COVID-19 Vaccination What treatments are available for COVID-19? People who recently tested positive for COVID-19 and have only mild to moderate illness may be eligible to receive monoclonal antibody treatment without being admitted to a hospital. Monoclonal antibody treatment is not a cure, but it may lessen the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and help keep high-risk patients out of the hospital. Learn more about Monoclonal Antibody Treatment.

Back to Top FAQs about Monoclonal Antibody Treatment for COVID-19 What are monoclonal antibodies? Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic natural antibodies’ ability to fight viruses such as COVID-19. Does monoclonal antibody treatment work? Clinical trials have shown fewer COVID-19-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits and a decrease in the amount of virus in an infected person’s blood in patients at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. How do I know if I’m eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment? Currently, monoclonal antibody treatment may only be used in adults and adolescents (12-17 years old) with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms who: Recently had a positive COVID-19 test Are within 10 days of first experiencing symptoms Do not need to be hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment Weigh at least 88 pounds Are age 65 and older or have chronic kidney disease, BMI of 35 or greater, diabetes, or an immunosuppressive disease For adolescents: high BMI, sickle cell disease, heart disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, a medical-related technological dependence, asthma or other chronic respiratory disease Are age 65 and older or have chronic kidney disease, BMI of 35 or greater, diabetes, or an immunosuppressive disease Are age 55 to 64 AND have cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, or COPD For adolescents: high BMI, sickle cell disease, heart disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, a medical-related technological dependence, asthma or other chronic respiratory disease If I test positive for COVID-19, how can I get this treatment? Talk to your health care provider as soon as you test positive for COVID-19 so they can determine if monoclonal antibodies are the right treatment for you. How are monoclonal antibodies administered to COVID-19 patients? Patients receive monoclonal antibody treatment through a single IV infusion, followed by at least one hour of observation. What are the side effects of monoclonal antibody treatment? The most common reported side effects are nausea and vomiting. Other side effects with bamlanivimab include diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and itchiness. Additional side effects with casirivimab/imdevimab include hyperglycemia and pneumonia. Receiving any medicine by IV may cause brief pain, bleeding, bruising, soreness, swelling and infection where you get the needle. Will my insurance cover monoclonal antibody treatment? Monoclonal antibodies are provided at no cost to patients. However, there may be other associated costs related to the process of infusing the antibodies that may be covered by insurance. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I have monoclonal antibody treatment? Those who have had monoclonal antibody treatment should wait 90 days before getting vaccinated.

For up to date information, see the FAQs about Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, and Congregate Living Facility Orders and Support Efforts. Back to Top FAQs about Testing Who should get tested? The Maryland Department of Health encourages the following individuals to get tested: Symptomatic​ ​individuals All who suspect exposure, including those who are asymptomatic Individuals who are at risk of exposure, including workers in frequent contact with the public in health care, emergency services, food and grocery, retail or manufacturing, public transportation, educational, and other congregate settings Individuals who have been in large gatherings Individuals who have traveled recently, including those who have traveled to a state with a COVID-19 test positivity rate above ten percent or a case rate over 20 per 100,000. Do I need to get testing for COVID-19 once I have been fully vaccinated? Once you have been fully vaccinated (two weeks after your second shot if it is a two-shot vaccine; two weeks after Johnson & Johnson single dose) you may still need to get a COVID-19 test if you have symptoms of COVID-19, and have had close contact with someone who has been confirmed to have the virus. Although the vaccines are very effective, like all vaccinations they are not 100 percent effective. Where am I able to be tested? Whom do I contact? There are more than 240 testing sites available throughout Maryland. Location, contact, and scheduling information for many of the COVD-19 test sites in Maryland can be found at  covidtest.maryland.gov. If in doubt, patients are encouraged to contact the site where they plan to be tested to verify that site’s appointment procedures and other testing requirements. What does the test consist of? What is the process? Generally, the test involves a swab (“q-tip”) inserted into the back of the patient’s nostrils or the lower portion of the nose (both methods are accurate and effective). Most patients report minor, temporary discomfort at most. Where can I learn more about the different types of tests available in Maryland? A table comparing common types of COVID-19 tests is now available at COVIDtest.maryland.gov. How long does it take to receive results? How do people who are tested get their results? Generally, the results will be available within approximately two to five days, depending on laboratory testing demands and resources. In most cases, you will have the option to be contacted with your results via text message or phone call or to retrieve your results through an online patient portal. ​Note (12/10/20): ​ Many labs are currently returning test results within 2-3 business days. However, due to the high volume of tests being processed across the country, it ​may​ take longer than expected to receive your results. Labs across the state are working as quickly and carefully as possible. Will I have to pay for the COVID-19 test? In many circumstances, tests are provided at no out-of-pocket cost to individuals. However, individuals should contact their health plan prior to receiving a COVID-19 test to determine whether testing is covered by the plan in their circumstance. Out-of-pocket expenses may apply if the test is not covered by the health plan. Maryland Medicaid will cover the costs of COVID-19 testing for its beneficiaries. Will my insurance cover treatment if I test positive for COVID-19? Health insurance plans cover medically necessary treatment for disease, but the treatment may be subject to deductibles, copayments, and/or coinsurance. You will need to pay those amounts, even if the care is covered. If you have a limited-benefits plan, there may be additional restrictions on what is covered. If I do have COVID-19, what happens? The vast majority of people recover from this disease in one to two weeks. Most people will have mild to moderate symptoms and will be advised to recover at home and isolate themselves from others. Any individual whose symptoms get worse should call a health care provider. After The Test What do I do while waiting for my results? Stay at home and self-isolate. Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Limit contact with pets and animals; wear a face covering when you are around others; clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Monitor your symptoms. If your symptoms get worse, please call your health care provider’s office. If you are having a medical emergency, such as difficulty breathing, call 911. Tell the 911 operator that you were tested for COVID-19 and are waiting for results. What do I do if my test results are positive for COVID-19? If you test positive, you should self-isolate at home. You can be with others after: At least 10 days since symptoms first appeared; and At least 24 hours with no fever without fever-reducing medication; and Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving. Continue to practice good hygiene, including frequent and thorough hand washing, disinfecting “high-touch” surfaces, and frequently washing clothing and bedding. Avoid contact with other members of the household and pets. Practice physical distancing within the home and wear a mask around other people. Also, please answer the call or text from MD COVID or (240) 466-4488 to help Maryland contact tracers slow the spread of COVID-19. Will my positive COVID-19 test results be reported to public health entities? Yes. Positive COVID-19 test results will be reported to the appropriate public health agency in accordance with applicable Maryland laws and regulations. When can I be around others after having COVID-19? Talk to your health care provider especially if you have a ​high-risk underlying health condition​ or if you are 65 years and older. You may need to stay away from other people longer. Most people can follow the CDC’s three conditions before being around others: When around others, remember to maintain six feet of distance and wear a face covering. Please visit ​covidtest.maryland.gov​ for additional information about testing and to find a testing site near you. Back to Top FAQs about Contact Tracing What is contact tracing? Contact tracing is the process of identifying people who may have come into contact with an individual with an infectious disease. The process involves identifying infected people, determining who they have been in close contact with while infectious and asking people who are potentially infected to stay home until it is clear they are not sick. For the coronavirus pandemic, contact tracing begins with a phone interview of the positive COVID-19 patient and obtaining details regarding the patient’s contacts, who they have interacted with and where they have gone recently. The next step involves locating people with whom the infected person has interacted during their infectious period. I tested positive, why haven't I gotten a call? While the goal of contact tracing is to talk to all cases and all of their named close contacts, when case counts get too high, it might not be possible. The key things to know if you test positive but don’t get a call are to isolate (please see the FAQs about Isolation and Quarantine) and to tell your close contacts of their exposure. Call your local health department if you need access to resources or have questions. And please answer our call the first time we call – the caller ID will read “MD COVID”. If you do not have caller ID, look for the phone number (240) 466-4488. I got a text message from the Maryland Department of Health. Is it legitimate? The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) might text people who test positive or their named contacts for a couple of reasons. The text message may remind people to answer our call when a contact tracer calls to get more people to answer on the first call. Another reason MDH might send a text is to provide the verification code that an infected person needs to share their COVID-19 diagnosis through MD COVID Alert, without having to wait for a contact tracer to call. What happens after the list of contacts is established? Following the interview with the infected patient, other individuals who came into close contact with the infected person will be contacted by phone and guidance will be provided regarding how to quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms. During quarantine individuals will be monitored by text, secure web survey or telephone and actively referred for testing should they develop symptoms. This process was developed to help prevent further person-to-person spread of the infection. Why is contact tracing necessary? Contact tracing is an essential tool used to decrease the spread of infectious disease and has been effectively employed during other health emergencies, such as the H1N1 pandemic in America and Ebola outbreaks in Africa. Effective use of contact tracing is a critical step in decreasing the number of COVID-19 cases. In fact, contact tracing was one of the “four building blocks” of public health response described by Governor Larry Hogan as critical in reopening Maryland — along with securing adequate supplies of PPE, expanding testing and ensuring Maryland had ample hospital surge capacity for infections. Who conducts contact tracing? Local health departments across the state are conducting contact tracing. Maryland has also contracted with NORC at the University of Chicago, one of the largest independent social research organizations in the United States, to assist in contact tracing efforts. How many contact tracers are actively tracking movements and locations of positive COVID-19 patients? Maryland currently has more than 1,500 contact tracers working through the Maryland Health Department and the 24 local health departments to conduct interviews with individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. With the recent increase in case counts, Maryland is hiring additional contact tracers to meet the demand. Does contact tracing damage my privacy and violate HIPAA laws? No. Contact tracers take extreme measures to protect the privacy of infected patients and maintain strict adherence to HIPAA regulations. During a trace investigation, a person will be notified that they may have come into contact with an infected individual, but the infected person’s name is not disclosed. What kinds of questions might a contact tracer ask me? If a contact tracer calls you, they will ask about your health, any potential symptoms you may have, and the duration of those symptoms. They may ask about your whereabouts for a specific period of time. If you had close contact with others during that time, they will ask for names and contact information for those individuals. The investigator will ask you to be as specific as possible about the nature and location of your interactions with others, as a way of understanding who might be potentially infected. What kind of questions will a contact tracer never ask? A contact investigator will never ask you for your social security number, financial or bank account information, or personal details unrelated to COVID-19. They will not ask for photographs or videos of any kind. They will not ask for your passwords. They will not ask for money or payment. They will ask for verification of your date of birth, address, and any other phone numbers you may have. What if I’m called, told to isolate or quarantine and need assistance? Call your local health department for help connecting with county resources that are available to you during your isolation or quarantine period. Please see the MDH FAQs about Isolation and Quarantine for more information. How do I know that a call from a contact tracer is not a scam? Is there a way to verify who is calling? With the prevalence of telephone scams and other fraud, we understand people’s reluctance to answer detailed questions from someone who calls to ask about their movements and contact with friends and loved ones. Maryland’s contact tracing efforts have several methods by which you can verify the identity of the caller. When your phone rings, the caller ID will read “MD COVID” on your screen. If you do not have caller ID on your phone, look for the phone number (240) 466-4488 or 1-800-559-6410. Depending on whether your contact investigator is calling directly from NORC or your local health department, there will also be a list of phone numbers you will be given to verify the caller’s identity. MDH and county health departments use the state-of-the-art contact tracing platform internally called ‘COVID Link,’ which assists in collecting information about people who test positive for COVID-19 and any individuals they have come into close contact with. COVID Link was operational on June 1, 2020. What is MD COVID Alert? MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notifications Express system for Maryland. This system was developed to assist, but not replace Maryland’s contact tracing efforts. MD COVID Alert uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology to quickly notify users who might have been exposed to someone who tested positive. This  technology can help Maryland residents stop the spread of COVID-19. To learn more about MD Covid Alert, please read these Frequently Asked Questions. How does MD COVID Alert protect my privacy? The service is opt-in only. You have full control to opt in to receive Exposure Notifications and can turn them off at any time. The service will never track your location — it uses Bluetooth rather than GPS. Your identity will never be revealed to anyone. The service will never collect, transmit or store any of your personal information.  Learn more about MD COVID Alert’s Privacy Policy. I have been vaccinated for COVID-19. Do I still need to isolate or quarantine if I am contacted? Fully vaccinated persons who meet the following criteria may no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19: Fully vaccinated (2 or more weeks following the second dose in a 2-dose series, or 2 or more weeks following one dose of a single-dose vaccine) Within 90 days following the last dose in the series Have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID-19 exposure Anyone who does not meet all three of the criteria should continue to follow current quarantine guidance after exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals who do not quarantine should still watch for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be tested for COVID-19. Vaccinated inpatients and residents in healthcare settings should continue to quarantine following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. CDC’s updated guidance for quarantine and isolation can be found here. All fully vaccinated persons who do not quarantine should also continue to: Follow all recommendations regarding facial coverings, social distancing, and other COVID-19 precautions; and Watch for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, if indicated. Do I have to quarantine if I have already had COVID-19? People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms. People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms. Back to Top FAQs about MD COVID Alert What is MD COVID Alert? MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notifications Express system of Maryland. This system was developed to assist, but not replace Maryland’s contact tracing efforts. MD COVID Alert uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology to quickly notify users who might have been exposed to someone who tested positive. This will reduce the risk of infection and help Maryland stop the spread of COVID-19. How can MD COVID Alert help with contact tracing efforts? Traditional methods of contact tracing are critical to containing the spread of infection. Technology can support and augment these efforts by allowing public health authorities to quickly notify people who might have been exposed to a person with COVID-19, including those the person might not know directly. This starts with MD COVID Alert on your smartphone. If you have an iPhone, opt-in to Exposure Notifications in your device settings. On Android, you can download the MD COVID Alert app on the Play Store. Where can I download MD COVID Alert? MD COVID Alert is available at no cost to you. For Apple users, you do not need to download an app – simply go to your phone’s Settings, enable Exposure Notifications, and select Maryland as your region. To enable MD COVID Alert, you must have one of the follow iOS versions: iPhone 6s or newer: iOS 13.7 or lateriPhone 5s, 6, or 6 Plus: iOS 12.5 All older devices: Currently not supported. Apple is working on solutions. We will share updates as more information is available. iPhones that support iOS 13.7 or later are: iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, XR, XS, XS Max, X, SE (2nd generation), 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, SE (1st generation). For Android users, download MD COVID Alert app through the Play Store. Android users can use MD COVID Alert if their phone supports Bluetooth Low Energy, Android Version 6 (API 23) or above, and can access the Google Play Store. Do I have to use MD COVID Alert? No. Using MD COVID Alert is voluntary, and you may choose to uninstall or disable it at any time. MD COVID Alert is intended for use by individuals 18 years of age or older. Can minors use MD COVID Alert? MD COVID Alert is for persons 13 years and older. MD COVID Alert is not intended for children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly allow a child under the age of 13 to use the service. If a child under the age of 13 enables MD COVID Alert and receives an exposure notification, they should show the alert to a parent or legal guardian. Questions can be sent to mdh.mdcovidalert@maryland.gov. How does MD COVID Alert work? MD COVID Alert works by assigning you a random number called a ‘random ID’. To ensure these random IDs cannot be used to identify users or their whereabouts, they change every 10-20 minutes. As the user goes about their day, their devices and other devices around them exchange the random IDs via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. On a daily basis, your phone downloads a list of all the random IDs associated with verified positive COVID-19 cases and checks them against the random IDs users have encountered in the two days prior to their positive test or symptom onset. If there’s a match, the system will notify users of the date of exposure. No other information about the exposure will be shared. Will MD COVID Alert protect my privacy? Your privacy is important to the Maryland Department of Health, Apple, and Google. You are in charge of how much information is shared. You must opt into the system in order for it to work and you can turn exposure notifications off any time. MD COVID Alert does not track your location. It does not collect or use the location from your device. It uses Bluetooth, which can be used to detect if two devices are near each other – without revealing where the devices are or who they belong to. All the Exposure Notification matching happens on your smartphone. The system does not share your identity with other users, Apple, or Google. Learn more about MD COVID Alert’s Privacy Policy. What counts as close contact? Close contact is described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as being within 6 feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to test specimen collection) until the time the person is isolated. Cumulative total can be determined by adding individual exposures to the same person over a 24-hour period (e.g., three 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes). This is approximated using Bluetooth technology. Specifics on Exposure Notifications What should I do if I get an alert from MD COVID Alert? See the I’ve Been Alerted. Now What? page. I received an exposure notification. How can I find my date of exposure? On an iPhone, go to Settings and open Exposure Notifications. The exposure date is found under “You might have been exposed to COVID-19… “ On an Android phone, the date of exposure is conveyed in the alert message under “possible exposure date”. Why does the exposure date reflect a day I didn’t leave the house? In order to preserve anonymity, the date of exposure is approximately within 24 hours of contact. Therefore, the contact could have occurred the previous day. In addition, because MD COVID Alert uses your phone’s Bluetooth technology to determine proximity, if another person used your phone somewhat distant to you (e.g., borrowed your phone and took it elsewhere), it is possible you could be notified of an exposure even if you did not leave the house. Is MD COVID Alert compatible with other exposure notification apps? MD COVID Alert is completely interoperable with Exposure Notifications apps in states that are using the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) National Key Server. More information and a full list of participating jurisdictions are available here.  Users that travel between these regions will receive Exposure Notifications if they come in close contact with another user that has verified a positive test result regardless of the State experience they are using. Does MD COVID Alert work outside of Maryland? Yes, MD COVID Alert’s exposure notifications will work outside of Maryland if the area that you are traveling to also has an exposure notifications mobile app interoperable through the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL). Currently, MD COVID Alert works with the neighboring jurisdictions of DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Users who work or travel between these regions will receive Exposure Notifications if they come in close contact with another user that has verified a positive test result. More information about APHL and a full list of participating jurisdictions is available here. I already downloaded an Exposure Notifications system from another state. Do I need to download MD COVID Alert, too? Yes. If you live in Maryland, it is important for you to enable Exposure Notifications based on the State where you currently live and where you expect to be tested and access services if needed. You can switch regions by: (On iPhone) Going to Settings > Exposure Notifications > Region > Add Another Region Select Region (United States > Maryland); (On Android) Open the MD COVID Alert app > Click Settings > Click Exposure Notifications > Click ‘Switch App’ Do I always need to leave MD COVID Alert open for the system to work? No. MD COVID Alert will run in the background, without draining your battery or data, when it is not open. You will need to make sure the system is installed, and Exposure Notifications service has been enabled for MD COVID Alert to work. Do I always need to keep Bluetooth turned on for MD COVID Alert to work? Yes. Bluetooth must always be turned on for the Exposure Notifications System to detect how close you are to other users. I tested positive, how do I get my verification code? To enter your positive test result into MD COVID Alert you will need a verification code from the Maryland Department of Health. You should receive a text message with your verification code once your test results have been reported to the Maryland Department of Health. If you do not receive your code by text, a contact tracer can share the code with you during their initial outreach. Please answer the call when you get a phone call from MD COVID or (240) 466-4488. How does MD COVID Alert determine who is a COVID-19 positive case? If an individual has MD COVID Alert enabled, they can self-report their positive test result by using a verification code provided by the Maryland Department of Health (see question above).  Once that individual submits their verification code, this will trigger exposure alerts to go out to other MD COVID Alert users that they were in close contact with. Will using MD COVID Alert drain my battery? MD COVID Alert uses Bluetooth Low Energy, which is designed to have minimal impact on battery life. You should not see a significant change in phone battery consumption. Will MD COVID Alert use a lot of data? No. Every day, MD COVID Alert downloads new anonymous keys for detecting possible exposures. You can expect this to consume a few megabytes of your data each day. Will MD COVID Alert work on iPads or Tablets? No, MD COVID Alert does not work on iPads or Tablets. Will this work with a smartwatch that is Bluetooth enabled? No, the MD COVID Alert technology was designed specifically for smartphones and is not supported on smartwatches. What does Matched Key Count mean? For users that dive deeper into their phone’s Exposure Notifications features, they may find the Matched Key Count. Every 4-6 hours, your phone runs checks against the ‘keys’ of phones that have a confirmed positive test. If you met the criteria to receive an exposure notification, you would receive a notification directly on your phone’s home screen (like a text message or weather alert).  Users do not need to review their Matched Key Count. During these regular checks, your phone is recording any possible matches in the “Matched Key Count” field. If you see a number larger than 0, this means your phone was in “contact” with a positive phone but did not meet the criteria MDH selected to receive an exposure notification. The criteria to receive an exposure notification is based on the CDC’s definition of a close contact, which means that your phone must be in close contact with another phone for at least 15 minutes or more, within 6 feet, and recorded over the course of 24 hours. If you have a “Matched Key Count” of 1 or more but did NOT receive an exposure notification message directly on your phone, this means you did not meet the exposure criteria.  For instance, you may have been within 10ft or you could have been in contact for only 5 minutes. Technical What phones can support MD COVID Alert? To enable MD COVID Alert on an iPhone, you must have one of the follow iOS versions: iPhone 6s or newer: iOS 13.7 or later iPhone 5s, 6, or 6 Plus: iOS 12.5 All older devices: Currently not supported. Apple is working on solutions. We will share updates as more information is available. iPhones that support MD COVID Alert are:iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, XR, XS, XS Max, X, SE (2nd generation), 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, SE (1st generation), 6, 6 Plus, and 5s. Android users can use MD COVID Alert if their phone supports Bluetooth Low Energy, Android Version 6 (API 23) or above, and can access the Google Play Store. For more information about Exposure Notifications, please visit www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications. How do I disable Exposure Notifications on an iPhone? You can disable all Exposure Notifications by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications and tapping Turn Off Exposure Notifications. This will also delete the Bluetooth Identifiers recorded from other devices, associated metadata, your Random Device Keys, and your Exposure Notifications regions. You can also delete the Bluetooth Identifiers, associated metadata, and Random Device Keys by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications > Exposure Logging and tapping Delete Exposure Log. If you turn off Bluetooth on your device by going to Settings > Bluetooth, that will disable the sharing and collection of random Bluetooth Identifiers with other devices. This means that the Public Health Authority for your active region won’t be able to notify you about exposures to someone with COVID-19 that occur while Bluetooth is off. The remaining features of Exposure Notifications will continue to operate while you have Bluetooth turned off. Turning Bluetooth back on will re-enable the sharing and collection of random Bluetooth Identifiers with other devices. Apple will disable the Exposure Notifications system on a regional basis when it is no longer needed. Within Settings I can see several Exposure Checks, many at the same time. Do these mean I was exposed? Within your device’s Settings menu, you can see an Exposure Notifications or Exposure Logging section (the path to these is slightly different on some devices, but is typically as stated here): iOS: Settings > Privacy > Health > COVID-19 Exposure Logging or Settings > Exposure Notifications Android: Settings > Google > COVID-19 Exposure Notifications. Within those menus, you can find an “Exposure checks” field with a timestamped list. These items are not exposures, but rather when your device made the checks against the tokens from positive users that your device has downloaded from the server to look if you have had an exposure. You may see several entries with the same date, as the keys of positive users are separated into a few files, and your device will download and check for matches within each of those files. If two people are in different rooms with a wall between them, does the wall block the Bluetooth signal or could the person in another room be identified as a close contact? A wall would be expected to diminish the signal strength between devices, but the extent of that would be determined by the materials and structure of the wall. It is possible, but unlikely, that two devices close to a shared wall would still have sufficient signal strength to trigger a notification. Once a person uploads their positive tests results, how long does it take MD COVID Alert to send out information that they tested positive? If a user submits a positive test result in MD COVID Alert to notify others, users that they were near can expect to receive an exposure notification within the next day from the time the report was submitted. This time is needed to make the positive user’s tokens available on the server and for other users’ devices to download those tokens and check for potential matches. What if people submit false test reports in MD COVID Alert? To prevent users from submitting false test results, MD COVID Alert requires users to verify their test result using a verification code. A contact tracer will call you on the phone and provide the code via SMS text. Click the link in the SMS text to enter the code into MD COVID Alert to report your positive test. MD COVID Alert will upload the list of anonymous keys it has been in contact with only after a test result has been verified. Do I need to be connected to Wifi or a cellular data connection for MD COVID Alert to work? The exchange of anonymous tokens between users is done using Bluetooth and does not require Wifi or a cellular data connection. If Bluetooth is turned on, your phone will exchange tokens with others. However, other functionality, including verification code submission and positive key downloads to receive notifications do require a Wifi or cellular data connection to work. Why does Location need to be enabled on Android devices? Location does not need to be enabled on Android devices with Android 11. Older versions of Android do require location to be enabled for Bluetooth to work, even though location data is not collected or used by MD COVID Alert. In 2015, in an effort to improve user privacy, Google built into Android a requirement that Location be turned on to enable Bluetooth. They did not anticipate the current need for MD COVID Alert to use Bluetooth technology without Location. MD COVID Alert does not collect any user location data. For additional information on location access on your Android phone, please visit Google’s Help page on Exposure Notifications and Android location settings. On an Android device, I get an “Internal error” when attempting to enable MD COVID Alert. How can I fix this? This can be an issue for Android devices where Google Play services have not been updated. To resolve this, follow these steps: On your Android phone or tablet, open Settings. Tap “Apps” or “Apps & notifications” then “See all apps.” Scroll down and tap “Google Play services” Scroll down and tap “App Details” or “App details in store” Tap “Update” or “Install” This should resolve your issue. If it does not, please visit: www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications. I turn my phone off periodically, usually a few hours per day to charge and/or reboot it. Does that affect MD COVID Alert? Yes, this does affect MD COVID Alert slightly. Turning off your phone will prevent receipt of anonymous key updates that allow for the exposure notifications to work effectively. If your phone is off while you are at home alone, then there will be no effect. You would not want your phone to be off when you might encounter other people outside your household. What can I do if my smartphone doesn’t support MD COVID Alert? MDH appreciates your interest in MD COVID Alert. Unfortunately, if your phone does not meet the version requirements, it is not possible to use MD COVID Alert. We understand that this may prevent some people from being able to use MD COVID Alert. We will keep the community updated on any changes in these requirements. Does it matter who my cell phone carrier is? No.  MD COVID Alert is supported by all phone carriers.  Users from all carriers with mobile devices with Android 6+ and iOS 13.7+ are able to use MD COVID Alert. What if a person submits a false test result in MD COVID Alert? To prevent users from submitting false test results, MD COVID Alert requires users to verify their test results using a verification code. An individual will receive their verification code via SMS text from the Maryland Department of Health or when speaking with a contact tracer. If you have questions about MD COVID Alert that are not answered here, please submit questions to mdh.mdcovidalert@maryland.gov or call the Maryland Department of Health Call Center at 877-319-1525. The Call Center is open Monday – Friday, 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. and is closed on the weekends. Back to Top FAQs about the Maryland COVID-19 Vaccination Plan and COVID-19 Vaccination Trending Questions and Answers Will I put my immigration status at risk if I get a COVID-19 vaccine? ¿Pondré en riesgo mi estado migratorio si me ponen la vacuna COVID-19? Su estado migratorio NO estará en peligro por vacunarse o hacerse la prueba del COVID-19. Si es su turno, vacúnese. Si cree que tiene el virus, hágase la prueba. Visite https://covidlink.maryland.gov/content/es para más información en español. Accessing a COVID-19 vaccine or test will NOT put your immigration status at risk. Get vaccinated if you are eligible. Get a test if you need one. For more information, visit: https://covidlink.maryland.gov/content/es/ Will it be even harder for older adults to get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment now that certain Maryland adults age 16 and older are eligible? Anyone in a previous phase has a fast track under our “Southwest Airlines boarding system” so that they will be prioritized for vaccines over later phases. Older adults who want a vaccine are encouraged to pre-register at their vaccination site of choice. To pre-register at a Maryland mass vaccination site, visit covidvax.maryland.gov. What are qualifying medical conditions under Phase 2B? All Marylanders age 16 and older who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to a qualifying medical condition are eligible for vaccination. See the CDC’s page People with Certain Medical Conditions for more information.  If you have a medical condition, speak with your healthcare provider. COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for and can be administered to most people with underlying medical conditions.  To pre-register at a Maryland mass vaccination site, visit covidvax.maryland.gov. How do I know if I have a qualifying disability under Phase 2B? All Marylanders age 16 and older who have a qualifying disability are eligible for vaccination. Eligible individuals included those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, Maryland Medicaid Employed Individuals with Disabilities (EID) individuals, Maryland Medicaid Rare and Expensive Case Management (REM) recipients; Marylanders receiving Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP) benefits, or Marylanders receiving long term services and supports through the state’s Medicaid waiver and state plan services. When will I be able to get the vaccine from my primary care doctor? In an effort to broaden access to the vaccine, Maryland has started distributing COVID-19 vaccines to an initial 37 and has since expanded to over 90 practices around the state, mostly in underserved communities. The state will continue to strategically roll out vaccines to more registered practices. Primary care practices will be able to call patients directly to schedule vaccine appointments. How can I book an appointment with a mobile vaccine clinic when it is in my area? Maryland’s mobile vaccine clinics and two Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mobile clinics will provide access to COVID-19 vaccinations for thousands of hard-to-reach Marylanders who live in remote or otherwise underserved areas beginning on the Eastern Shore. Appointments will be booked through the health department in the individuals’ county of residence. Will a “vaccine passport” be mandated in the future? The State of Maryland has no plans to require a vaccine passport at this time. Can the Maryland GoVAX COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center provide an update on an individual's place in the mass vaccination pre-registration queue for an appointment? A Support Advocate cannot provide information on your wait time or your “place in line” for a vaccination appointment.  Pre-registration ensures you will be notified to make an appointment when vaccines are available and you are eligible to receive a vaccine. By the end of April, Maryland will have 12 state-supported mass vaccination sites open across the state.  As vaccine allocation from the Federal government increases, and with the state’s increased vaccination infrastructure, wait times should decrease. Currently, 39 percent of adults in Maryland have been vaccinated and on average over 55,000 shots are given to Marylanders each day. Will a Support Advocate at the Maryland GoVax COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center be able to answer questions concerning the vaccine and my medical condition? An Advocate can answer general questions about COVID-19 and the vaccine, help determine vaccination eligibility, assist with pre-registration for a COVID-19 vaccine at a state-run mass vaccination site, or help locate a COVID-19 vaccine provider closest to you. If you have questions about your allergies or health conditions and getting the COVID-19 vaccine, you should talk to your healthcare provider for medical advice. Live Support Advocates are available to callers using both voice and text services at any time. Support Advocates are available in English and Spanish. Does the Maryland GoVax COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center provide assistance in languages other than English and Spanish? Live Support Advocates are available to callers using both voice and text services at any time in English and Spanish. The Support Center has access to translators in over 100 languages to assist callers with pre-registration. Will I be refused a vaccine if I don’t have ID or Insurance? At state-operated mass vaccination sites, if you are unable to provide an ID, you will be asked to sign an affidavit certifying under penalty of perjury that you are eligible to receive a vaccine.  A provider may ask if you have insurance or other documentation requirements, but you do not need to be insured to get a vaccine. What is the difference between registering for a vaccine and a vaccine appointment? Registering is not the same as scheduling a vaccination appointment. You fill out a registration form to request a vaccination appointment. Completing this form does not create an appointment. Once an appointment is available, you will be contacted. The time  between submitting the registration form and getting notification to schedule an appointment varies by vaccination site and provider depending on the number of eligible people who register and the overall vaccine supply. How do I cancel my appointment at a mass vaccination site? As part of the appointment registration process, you will receive an email and a text message confirmation. There is a link in the confirmation that you can use to cancel your appointment. We recommend you save the notifications so you can refer back to them. If you cannot locate your confirmation and you need assistance, contact the Maryland GoVAX COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center at 1-855-MDGOVAX (1-855-634-6829) from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. How do I cancel a vaccination appointment at a pharmacy, hospital or local health department? How you will cancel your vaccination appointment depends on where you made your appointment. Always check your vaccination appointment confirmation email or text message to see if there are specific instructions for canceling or rescheduling your appointment.  If you cannot find your appointment confirmation or there are no instructions, check the website where you are scheduled for more information. If I get COVID-19 before being fully vaccinated, when can I get my second vaccine? With most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots for them to work and protect you from COVID-19. If you get COVID-19 before getting your second shot, you should wait until you recover and meet the CDC’s criteria for leaving isolation before getting your second shot. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait until At least 10 days have passed since symptom onset and At least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and Other symptoms have improved. Those without symptoms should wait 10 days after the date of their first positive COVID-19 test. According to the CDC, the second dose of the vaccine should be given as close to the recommended time frame as possible. However, if a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, there is no need to restart the series. COVID-19 Vaccination Plan: What is the Maryland COVID-19 Vaccination Plan? Maryland will distribute the vaccines to seven different priority groups based on relative risk of exposure or developing serious illness. Vaccine prioritization may be subject to change. The state has adopted a rolling vaccine allocation model, meaning it may not wait for every member of a particular group to get vaccinated before moving ahead; individuals will still have the opportunity to be vaccinated in subsequent phases. What is Maryland doing to help make sure people can get vaccinated against COVID-19? Maryland is working with partners at the federal, state, local and community level to work through the logistics of delivering, storing and administering the COVID-19 vaccine. Maryland is also making sure that people have the information they need to be confident in deciding to get vaccinated. Key priorities include: Developing and regularly sharing clear and accurate information with people to make sure they understand the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated and can make informed decisions. Helping healthcare providers answer their patients’ questions about the vaccine. Engaging communities and individuals in an equitable and inclusive way to ensure that people have opportunities to ask questions and get clear, accurate information about the COVID-19 vaccine. Easy access to COVID-19 vaccines is equally critical. Maryland is working with public health professionals, healthcare providers, and other partners to make sure people can easily get a COVID-19 vaccine and that cost is not a barrier. What percentage of the community needs to get vaccinated to have herd immunity to COVID-19? Experts do not know what percentage of people would need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity to COVID-19. Herd immunity is a term used to describe when enough people have protection—either from previous infection or vaccination—that it is unlikely a virus or bacteria can spread and cause disease. As a result, everyone within the community is protected even if some people don’t have any protection themselves. The percentage of people who need to have protection in order to achieve herd immunity varies by disease. Does Maryland have a campaign to address any concerns people may have about getting the vaccine? MDH is working with trusted community partners, priority group representatives and representatives of vulnerable populations to launch a public health campaign that focuses on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. Materials under development will be thoroughly researched, easy to understand, transparent and available to all Marylanders, especially those who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. MDH’s campaign messaging will represent all regions and demographic groups and will complement communications from CDC, pharma and national, regional and community-based health organizations. Will there be enough vaccines for everyone? Maryland is currently in Phase 2B of its vaccination plan. On April 27th, Maryland will enter Phase 3 where everyone over the age of 16 will be eligible to receive a vaccine. How are vaccines distributed across the state? Each week, state health officials start the process as soon as the federal government informs Maryland of its next week’s allocation. This takes place sometime between Tuesday and Thursday the week before vaccines are delivered to the vaccination sites. Once the state places its orders with the federal government—generally on Fridays—providers are notified. State health officials ensure that each jurisdiction receives a proportional share by population across all providers. What is Maryland doing to get more people vaccinated? The state’s daily rate of doses administered continues to increase dramatically. Here are some of the actions the state has taken: Mobilizing the Maryland National Guard to provide support at vaccination clinics and to set up mass vaccination sites, along with hundreds of Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps volunteers. Establishing mass vaccination sites statewide including Six Flags America in Prince George’s County, M&T Bank Stadium, Regency Furniture Stadium in Charles County, Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury, Hagerstown Premium Outlets in Washington County and additional regional sites which are being finalized. Continuing to expand partnerships among neighborhood retail pharmacies, including CVS, Giant, Walmart, Safeway, and Rite Aid. How will vaccinations be distributed as part of Maryland’s phased vaccination plan? Maryland will distribute the vaccines to seven different priority groups. Will an influenza (flu) vaccine protect me from COVID-19? Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19. However, flu vaccination has many other important benefits. Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization and death. Getting a flu vaccine this fall will be more important than ever, not only to reduce your risk from flu but also to help conserve potentially scarce health care resources. Why is it important to get the flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic? Efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, have led to decreased use of routine preventive medical services, including immunization services. Ensuring that you continue or start getting routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for protecting yourself and others from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks, including flu. Routine vaccination prevents illnesses that lead to unnecessary medical visits and hospitalizations, which further strain the healthcare system. For the upcoming flu season, flu vaccination will be very important to reduce flu because it can help reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and lessen the resulting burden on the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic. A flu vaccine may also provide several individual health benefits, including keeping you from getting sick with flu, reducing the severity of your illness if you do get the flu and reducing your risk of a flu-associated hospitalization. For more information about seasonal influenza in Maryland, visit here. What can I do to help protect myself from getting COVID-19 until I can receive a vaccine? You should cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay 6 feet away from others, avoid crowds and wash your hands often. Get more information about these and other steps you can take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Marylanders are encouraged to visit covidlink.maryland.gov to learn more. COVID-19 Vaccines: What is a COVID-19 vaccine? A COVID-vaccine is one way to prevent serious illness due to COVID-19. Vaccination causes your body to create antibodies without getting sick with the COVID-19 disease. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and other experts will provide recommendations on priority groups and when groups should be vaccinated. Guidance on determining and providing the vaccine to priority groups will be based on the principles included in the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Interim Updated Planning Guidance on Allocating and Targeting Pandemic Influenza Vaccine During an Influenza Pandemic. How were vaccines created and were they rushed to market? Since the start of the pandemic, the federal government has worked with several pharmaceutical companies to develop and distribute millions of vaccine doses for COVID-19 as quickly as possible while following extensive protocols to ensure that the vaccines are safe and effective. How do we know the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met FDA’s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA). Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines will undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. What is an emergency use authorization and how is it used to respond to COVID-19? In certain types of emergencies, the FDA can issue an EUA to provide more timely access to critical medical products that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options. The EUA process is different from full FDA approval, clearance or licensing because the EUA standard requires significantly less data than otherwise would be required for approval, clearance or licensing by the FDA. This enables the FDA to authorize the emergency use of medical products that meet the criteria for issuance within weeks rather than months to years. It must be determined that the vaccines are safe and effective in diminishing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms to gain an FDA emergency use authorization or full licensing. What are the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines? To learn more about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see: Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Information about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Information About Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine How is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine different from the others? The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is slightly different from the existing vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. It is a single-dose vaccine that is made from a virus that causes the common cold and contains a piece of DNA that instructs the body to make the COVID-19 spike protein. This triggers an immune system response, giving you protection should you ever be exposed to the real virus in the future. You cannot get COVID-19 or a cold from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, because it does not contain any live virus. Learn more at Understanding and Explaining Viral Vector COVID-19 Vaccines. In clinical trials, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe/critical illness and totally effective in preventing death from COVID-19. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tested against the new COVID-19 variants and still performed well. Do the COVID-19 vaccines have any side effects? After the COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. This is a normal sign that may indicate your body is building immunities to protect you from the virus. The side effects of the COVID-19 vaccination may feel like flu and might even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Learn more about what side effects to expect and get helpful tips on how to reduce pain and discomfort after your vaccination. What are the common misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine? Now that there are authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., accurate vaccine information is critical. Here are the facts behind some of the most common vaccine myths: MYTH: COVID-19 vaccines are used to microchip people.FACT: There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will not track people or gather personal information into a database. MYTH: You can get COVID-19 from the vaccine.FACT: None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID-19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. However, the goal for each of them is to teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work. MYTH: COVID-19 vaccines will alter my DNA.FACT: According to the CDC, the first COVID-19 vaccines to reach the market are messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines. Messenger RNA vaccines work by instructing cells in the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. Injecting messenger RNA into your body will not interact or do anything to the DNA of your cells. Human cells break down and get rid of the messenger RNA soon after they have finished using the instructions. How many doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will be needed? Will a booster dose be needed? The number of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine that will be needed will depend on the type of vaccine that is administered. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, while the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is one dose. When giving two doses, they are usually given approximately one month apart. It is also possible that over time, additional doses of vaccine may be needed to provide continued protection. It will take ongoing evaluation over several months and years to understand how our immune systems respond to this virus and how vaccines that become available assist in that response. Will a COVID-19 vaccine need to be given annually? At this time, we only have information about the length of immunity for as long as people were vaccinated during the trials. For example, if the first people in the study were vaccinated in July 2020 and the vaccine is licensed in December 2020, we will only have information about the immune response up to 5 months after vaccination. The vaccine manufacturer will continue to monitor vaccine recipients for several months or more, so that over time, we will continue to get a better picture of the durability of immunity. With this information, we will be better able to understand whether vaccines against COVID-19 will require annual dosing like influenza. How long will it take before a COVID-19 vaccine is able to prevent serious illness for the recipient? Generally, it takes a week or two for immunity to develop following vaccination, but the specific timeline for any coronavirus vaccine will depend to some extent on which type of vaccine is licensed. For example, a live, weakened vaccine requires time to reproduce in the body, whereas an inactivated vaccine is given at a dose that will generate immunity. On the other hand, because the live, weakened vaccine reproduces to generate immunity, it might provide a more robust immune response than an inactivated vaccine. What is a COVID-19 variant, and will the vaccine protect me from it? Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic, including here in Maryland. Scientists are confident that the currently authorized vaccines are effective against the variants, but more studies are now being conducted to determine the best ways to maintain protection against COVID-19 illness. For more information, see the latest from the CDC on New Variants of the Virus that Causes COVID-19. Can I choose what brand of vaccine I get? It is not possible to predetermine or choose which vaccine you will get for your first dose. The brand of COVID-19 vaccine you will first receive depends on the date and location of your vaccination. The availability of a certain brand – for a first dose –  at any vaccination site varies weekly based on a variety of factors including the State’s supply and allocation of doses from the federal government. All of the available vaccines have been proven highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 disease. Registering for a COVID-19 Vaccine: Where can I get vaccinated? How do I register or make an appointment? There are more than 100 vaccination providers across the state, including hospitals, pharmacies, and local health departments. Visit covidvax.maryland.gov to find a vaccination clinic near you. You will need to contact the clinic you select to register and/or to schedule an appointment. The clinic will verify your eligibility to be vaccinated. You must have an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. What do I need to know before I go get the vaccine? You need an appointment to get a vaccine. Everyone is eligible for a shot, just not at the same time. Before making an appointment, check to see that you are eligible under one of the current open phases.  The vaccine provider may ask you for documents that show you are in the eligibility group you claim or ask you to sign a form saying you are eligible. Remember, you can get a vaccine even if you do not have insurance, a driver’s license, or a Social Security number. Find a vaccination site that you can get to for both your first and second shot. Before leaving your first appointment, make sure you have a second appointment scheduled from the same site, or know how to schedule it. Be sure to get your second dose. You will need both shots for the vaccine to protect you. What can I expect at my vaccination appointment? When you get the vaccine, you and your healthcare worker will both need to wear masks that cover your nose and mouth. Stay 6 feet away from others while inside and in lines. Depending on where you book your appointment, you may be asked to provide documents that show you are in the eligibility group you claim or to sign a form saying you are eligible. You can still get your COVID-19 vaccine without insurance, an ID, or a Social Security number. The site should give you a vaccination card that tells you what COVID-19 vaccine you received, the date, and the place you got it.  Keep this card in a safe place. You will need it for your second shot and to keep for your records. Consider taking a picture of the card for safe keeping. The provider should also give you a fact sheet that tells you more about the COVID-19 vaccine you are getting.  After your shot, you should be monitored on-site for 15-30 minutes for any sign of an allergic reaction. How do I set an appointment for my second vaccine? MDH has instructed COVID-19 vaccine providers to ensure that recipients are scheduled for a second dose before leaving their first-dose appointment. Vaccine recipients who do not yet have a second-dose appointment can schedule by contacting the site or provider where they received their first dose. Pfizer vaccine recipients’ second dose should be scheduled for a time no earlier than three weeks after the first dose; Moderna vaccine recipients’ second dose should be scheduled for a time no earlier than four weeks after the first dose. If it is not possible to schedule an appointment for the second dose at the recommended interval, schedule an appointment at the next earliest time available. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers additional information about the administration of second doses. Do I have to pay for the vaccine? No, you will not have to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine providers may request insurance information to be reimbursed by your insurer, but Marylanders will not receive a bill for their COVID-19 vaccination. What documentation do I need to bring with me for my vaccination appointment? COVID-19 vaccine providers may ask for documentation that shows you are in the phase and priority group you claim. You may want to bring a government-issued ID, and any other documentation specific to your situation to your appointment. For example, if you are claiming eligibility based on your employment, you may want to bring your employee identification. At state-operated mass vaccination sites, if you are unable to provide documentation, you will be asked to sign an affidavit certifying under penalty of perjury that you are eligible to receive a vaccine. Can I switch my existing vaccine appointment over to a family member? At state-operated mass vaccination sites, appointments are not transferable. Some non-state-operated sites may permit appointments to be transferred from one person to another. Please contact your vaccine provider for more information. What can I do if a vaccination site on the site finder at coronavirus.maryland.gov/pages/vaccine will not load for me? If you are not using Google Chrome, try using it as your browser. If you still cannot load the site from your computer, you can call the Maryland GoVAX COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center at 1-855-MDGOVAX (1-855-634-6829) from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. Support Center advocates/agents can schedule a vaccination appointment at a mass vaccination site or help you find a vaccination provider close to you. They can also help with general questions about COVID-19, the vaccine, and vaccination eligibility. Mass Vaccination Site Pre-registration FAQs Is pre-registration an appointment? No. Pre-registration does not automatically schedule an appointment for you to receive a vaccine. Based on availability of vaccine and your eligibility, you will be contacted once it is your turn to schedule an appointment. Can I confirm I am pre-registered? Will I be able to see where I am in line for an appointment? Yes, you will be able to check your status in the system, but it will not indicate where you are in the queue. We will provide regular updates on the progression of appointment releases to eligible populations. How do I know that my appointment at one of the mass vaccination sites is confirmed? As part of the appointment registration process, you will receive an email and a text message confirmation. These notifications will have information on both your first and second vaccination appointment dates since both appointments are made when you register. The second appointment will be about 21 days after the first. Please make every effort to attend your scheduled second dose appointment. We recommend you save the notifications so you can refer back to them. If you cannot locate your notification and believe you have an appointment, contact the Maryland GoVAX COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center at 1-855-MDGOVAX (1-855-634-6829) from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. Can I choose which vaccine I receive? Constituents will be informed of the vaccine being administered at the mass vaccination site location where they are being scheduled for an appointment. Can I update my pre-registration account information? Constituents will be able to contact the COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center at 1-855-MDGOVAX (1-855-634-6829), to update certain information. Can I pre-register on someone’s behalf? Yes, you can sign up for as many people as you need to, but you will have to go through the same process each time. Do I need to sign up if I am already pre-registered through my local hospital or health department? Yes. We have invited county health departments to share their information with us, but for now, constituents will need to sign up for the new system, which asks for more detailed information than most providers do. Eligibility for COVID-19 Vaccine: Who is now eligible for vaccines? Maryland is now in Phase 2B of our phased distribution plan. Eligible groups now include: All Marylanders age 60 and older Marylanders ages 16+ with underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 illness Marylanders ages 16+ with disabilities who are receiving SSI or SSDI benefits, Maryland Medicaid EID individuals, Maryland Medicaid REM recipients, and Marylanders receiving TDAP benefits Marylanders receiving long term services and supports through the state’s Medicaid waiver and state plan services (learn more) All licensed, registered and certified health care providers and health care workers Residents and staff of nursing homes, assisted living, independent living, group homes and other congregate facilities Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities Law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, corrections, and public safety workers Education staff, including K-12 teachers, support staff and daycare providers Front line judiciary staff Food/agriculture production, critical manufacturing, U.S. Postal Service, public mass transit, grocery store employees Veterinarians and support staff Clergy and other essential support for houses of worship Some severely immunocompromised Marylanders, such as those receiving chemotherapy, and those with certain immune disorders who require frequent medical care. Where can I get information about COVID-19 vaccines and the current vaccination status in Maryland? The state continues to issue vaccination updates through a number of channels, including our statewide 2-1-1 texting service. To opt-in to receive these alerts, text ‘MdReady’ to 898-211. Marylanders are also encouraged to visit covidlink.maryland.gov to review safety information and learn more about the state’s COVID-19 vaccination plan. How are essential workers being defined? Please visit the Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19 Response (cisa.gov). Are the COVID-19 vaccines safe for pregnant women? Yes. If you are pregnant, you may choose to be vaccinated when it’s available to you. There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. There is no routine recommendation for taking a pregnancy test before you get a COVID-19 vaccine. If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talking with a healthcare provider may might help you make an informed decision. Learn more at vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Should women who are breastfeeding get the COVID-19 vaccine? There is currently no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women or on the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. People who are breastfeeding and are part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, such as healthcare personnel, may choose to be vaccinated. Available data on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered to pregnant women is not yet available. There is also no data at this time on the effects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on breastfed infants or on milk production/excretion. How are individuals with underlying health conditions being prioritized? All Marylanders age 16 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 illness are now eligible for vaccination. Individuals who are currently receiving hospital-based treatment, including in hospital outpatient centers, AND diagnosed with at least one of the following conditions are also eligible: Cancer patients who are currently in active treatment End stage renal disease patients requiring hemodialysis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Solid organ transplant recipients Sickle cell disease patients Diabetic patients (Type 1 and Type 2) Individuals who are diagnosed with these medical conditions but are not currently receiving hospital-based treatment, including in hospital outpatient centers, will be eligible to receive the vaccine in Maryland’s Phase 2 COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Should people with severe allergies get the COVID-19 vaccine? The CDC says that people who have experienced severe reactions to prior vaccines or injectable drugs can still get any of the approved vaccines for COVID-19, but should discuss the risks with their doctors ahead of time. There have been reports that some people have experienced both severe and non-severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine, also known as an EpiPen, or if they must go to the hospital. Some people have also experienced non-severe allergic reactions within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with symptoms such as hives, swelling, and wheezing. If you have had an immediate allergic reaction—severe or non-severe—to any ingredient in any of the approved vaccines, you should not receive that vaccine. If you had a severe or non-severe allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose. For these reasons, and to assure your safety, you are requested to stay at the vaccination site and in the proximity of a healthcare provider for 15-30 minutes after receiving the vaccination. Can children get the COVID-19 vaccine? Children under the age of 16 will not be able to get vaccinated at this time. This is because very few children have been part of the clinical trials to date. More research is needed to make sure any COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for infants and children. Am I able to get my vaccine outside of my county of residence? Any individual may receive a vaccine at any time, provided that their priority group has been identified as eligible and an appointment is available at a vaccine clinic. A COVID-19 vaccine administration site may establish additional appointment requirements or other restrictions necessary for the management of individuals and administration of the vaccine. If someone is in Phase 1 but not a Maryland resident can they still receive the vaccine? (Do you have to be a MD resident to receive the vaccine in Maryland?) While we are not turning anyone away (if eligible), we are certainly prioritizing Maryland residents for vaccine administration. Any individual may receive a vaccine at any time, provided that their priority group has been identified as eligible and an appointment is available at a vaccine clinic. A COVID-19 vaccine administration site may establish additional appointment requirements or other restrictions necessary for the management of individuals and administration of the vaccine. When will I get vaccinated? In support of our COVID-19 vaccination plan, Maryland is working swiftly with our federal, state and local partners to expand the state’s COVID-19 vaccination network. Soon, all Marylanders 16 and older will be eligible for vaccination. Continue to visit CovidLink for eligibility updates and more information. If you had the virus and recovered will you still be able or need to get the vaccine? Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. Learn more about why getting vaccinated is a safer way to build protection than getting infected. If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Why GoVAX? How do we know the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met FDA’s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA). Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines will undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Is a COVID-19 vaccine necessary? COVID-19 infections can be a minor hindrance or lead to severe disease or even death. There are many reasons to get vaccinated. Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting COVID-19 may offer some natural protection, known as immunity. But experts don’t know how long this protection lasts, and the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 far outweighs any benefits of natural immunity. COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness. Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Why should I get vaccinated? The COVID-19 vaccine works with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. The vaccines are shown to be highly effective at preventing serious illness from COVID-19, and will also help protect the people around you. Together with wearing masks, washing your hands, and practicing physical distancing, getting vaccinated will help us put an end to this deadly pandemic. Join the state’s vaccine confidence campaign. Why would I need a vaccine if I can do other things — like social distancing, washing my hands and wearing a mask — to prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading? Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from others, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations  to protect yourself and otherswill offer the best protection from COVID-19. Post COVID-19 Vaccination: Does immunity after getting COVID-19 last longer than protection from COVID-19 vaccines? The protection someone gains from having an infection (called natural immunity) varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. Since this virus is new, we don’t know how long natural immunity might last. Some early evidence—based on some people— seems to suggest that natural immunity may not last very long. Regarding vaccination, we won’t know how long immunity lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works. Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are trying to learn more about, and the CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. If I get the vaccine, do I still have to wear a mask and practice social distancing? Yes. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following the CDC’s recommendations for how to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on steps everyone should take to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. Once I get vaccinated, will I receive any sort of documentation to show that I have received the COVID-19 vaccine? If you receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, both of which require two doses,  you will receive a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card once you receive your first dose. It will also remind you of when you will need to return to receive your second dose. You will need to bring the card with you when you return for the second dose so that it can be documented on the card. If you receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which only requires only one dose, you will receive a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card which will show that you have received the single dose. You can also get a copy of your immunization record by going to Md.MyIR.net. I was already vaccinated; do I still need to isolate or quarantine? Fully vaccinated persons who meet the following criteria may no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19: Fully vaccinated (2 or more weeks following the second dose in a 2-dose series, or 2 or more weeks following one dose of a single-dose vaccine) Within 90 days following the last dose in the series Have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID-19 exposure Anyone who does not meet all three of the criteria should continue to follow current quarantine guidance after exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals who do not quarantine should still watch for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be tested for COVID-19. Vaccinated inpatients and residents in healthcare settings should continue to quarantine following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. CDC’s updated guidance for quarantine and isolation can be found here. All fully vaccinated persons who do not quarantine should also continue to: Follow all recommendations regarding facial coverings, social distancing, and other COVID-19 precautions; and Watch for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, if indicated. If I have all of my required vaccine shots and have a Vaccination Record Card, do I still need to get a COVID-19 test prior to coming into Maryland? The MDH travel advisory remains in place, and Marylanders continue to be encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 upon their return from out-of-state travel. Maryland strongly advises that travel be limited to essential purposes only.  Even if you are vaccinated against COVID-19, you may still be exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. After exposure, people can “carry” the virus that causes COVID-19 but not feel sick or have any symptoms. For this reason, even after vaccination, we need to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic as we learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions. Don’t see your question answered? Ask A Vaccine Question Back to Top FAQs about Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, and Congregate Living Facility Orders and Support Efforts Background Information In March, the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) issued Recommendations for Infection Control and Prevention of COVID-19 in Facilities Serving Older Adults and guidance for Preparing for and Responding to COVID-19 in Long-term Care and Assisted Living Facilities. In response to increasing cases of COVID-19 in Maryland’s nursing facilities, Governor Larry Hogan issued his first executive order specific to nursing homes and other health care facilities on April 5. The order authorized MDH to take any action necessary to protect Maryland’s most vulnerable population from the virus. This order was amended and superseded by the April 29 order.  These orders created a framework of support for nursing homes and other health care facilities, along with new requirements, aimed at protecting residents and staff. Currently,  the following directives and orders from the Maryland Department of Health are in effect: Amended Directive and Order Regarding Nursing Home Matters — 02/11/2021 Amended Directive and Order Regarding Assisted Living Program Matters — 10/01/2020 Amended Directive and Order Regarding Various Healthcare Matters — 02/11/2021 What action has the state taken to help nursing home residents treated for COVID-19 in the hospital when discharged? Since April 5th, previously ill residents are guaranteed the right to return to their “home” facility if the facility can follow the CDC recommendations for transmission-based precautions. The nursing home matters order directs the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) to assist hospitals and nursing homes in placing patients. OHCQ can be reached at mdh.dischargeassist@maryland.gov. What is the testing policy for Maryland nursing home facilities? As of November 17, all nursing home staff, volunteers, and vendors who are regularly in a facility must be tested at least twice a week using one mandatory PCR Assay and one rapid POC COVID-19 test on separate days. The  MDH strongly recommends that all nursing homes test all staff to the maximum degree possible including testing twice a week using a POC system. Individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 within the timeframe established by CDC and whose positive test results have been documented are exempted. What is the testing policy for Maryland assisted living facilities? All assisted living facilities with 50 or more licensed beds must test all staff, volunteers, and vendors who are in the facility regularly based on the local jurisdiction’s positivity rate as identified by CMS in the past week: Testing at least once a month where the local jurisdiction’s positivity rate is below or equal to 5%; Testing at least once a week where the local jurisdiction’s positivity rate is 5%-10%; and Testing at least twice as week where the local jurisdiction’s positivity rate is over 10%. MDH strongly recommends that all staff, volunteers, and regular vendors who are in a facility with 50 or more beds, be tested on a weekly basis for COVID-19 using a PCR Assay test or an approved rapid POC COVID-19 test. Individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID19 within the timeframe established by CDC and whose positive test results have been documented are exempted. When a resident or staff member tests COVID-19 positive, all residents who have not previously tested positive for COVID-19 in the previous 90 days must be tested using a PCR assay test. Testing of all negative residents must be repeated weekly until there are no PCR assay confirmed positive results among residents and staff for at least 14 days since the most recent positive result. Assisted living facilities with less than 50 licensed beds must test weekly until no new resident infections are confirmed in a 14-day period since the most recent positive result.  Individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 within the timeframe established by the CDC and whose positive test results have been documented are exempted. Do visitors have to be tested? Currently, nursing homes and assisted living facilities have different requirements. Effective November 17, all nursing home visitors must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours prior to their indoor visit. Under MDH’s current assisted living directives and orders, visitors are not required to have a COVID-19 test prior to visiting an assisted living facility.  However, individual facilities may have facility specific guidance in place regarding visitor testing. MDH recommends that visitors take all precautions to protect their loved ones including staying home if sick and getting tested before they visit. Facilities screen all visitors for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, including temperature checks. Facilities will refuse entrance to anyone screening positive for symptoms of COVID-19. All visitors, regardless of type of facility, must wear the appropriate face covering (e.g., surgical mask, cloth face covering) at all times when they are inside the facility. What are the criteria for opening facilities to indoor visitors? If a nursing home is currently in outbreak status or the local jurisdiction is at 10% positivity or greater, then indoor visitation is suspended except for compassionate care visits. Each facility individually determines requests for compassionate care visits. Additionally, if the local jurisdiction is within 5-10% positivity, each nursing home must restrict the number of indoor visitors to no more than 5% of the total residents at the facility at any one time. And, if a local jurisdiction is below 5% positivity, nursing homes must continue to implement Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance on visitation (QSO-20-39-NH). Either MDH or a local health department may direct a facility to a more restrictive set of conditions at any point. Assisted living programs are reminded that indoor visitation is not permitted if the facility is currently conducting outbreak testing,in accordance with federal guidance on this subject. Any facility may implement additional visitation restrictions, to include the number of individuals allowed in the facility at any given time or visitor testing, on a facility-specific basis given each facility’s circumstances and infection control guidelines. What are the criteria for outdoor visitation? For outdoor visitation, all facilities must  follow the CMS guidance on nursing home visitation (QSO-20-39-NH) and any additional MDH guidance. Either MDH or a local health department may direct a facility to a more restrictive set of conditions at any point Who is responsible for testing staff, volunteers, and vendors? Each facility is responsible for making appropriate contractual and financial arrangements for the testing of staff, volunteers, and vendors. Each facility must  establish and maintain COVID-19 testing arrangements with laboratories for PCR Assay-based testing. How is Maryland helping nursing homes with the new testing regulations? Beginning the week of November 16, the State will provide all nursing homes with Abbott BinaxNow POC tests to conduct twice a week testing of staff through the end of the 2020. The State will provide quantities of Becton, Dickinson & Co. Veritor test supplies for purchase for nursing homes that have those POC systems. On October 1, Governor Larry Hogan announced that the state would allocate an additional $6 million to help nursing home facilities cover the cost of testing staff as a result of new federal and state testing guidelines and reopening facilities to indoor visitation. Nursing homes can register and schedule a testing date with CIAN Diagnostics of Frederick for  two free rounds of diagnostic testing services. Staff testing will be offered on a first-come first-serve basis during  November 9 through December 18. How is Maryland helping congregate facilities face the challenges associated with COVID-19 and required compliance? In July, Governor Hogan appointed Dr. Jeffrey S. Woolford Director of Community and Facility Initiatives. In this role, Dr. Woolford leads all non-regulatory COVID-19 matters involving nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, and other congregate living settings. Additionally, the state has implemented and deployed Technical Assistance Teams (TATs) in an effort to support facilities with meeting the many and various directives from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), Governor Larry Hogan, MDH, and local health departments related to COVID-19. What are Rapid Response Teams (RRT)? A Rapid Response Team is the initial team sent to evaluate a facility when assistance is requested by the facility, or at the request of the MDH or local health department. Depending on the reason for the RRT’s deployment, the team may consist of a Technical Assistance Team (TAT), a Certified Infection Control Nurse, and a local health department representative. What are Technical Assistance Teams (TATs)? These non-regulatory teams provide support to facilities by reviewing operational practices. If necessary they can help a facility to improve those practices or put preventive measures in place that may ultimately mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  TATs prioritize facility visits based on a risk matrix that looks at 10 factors to determine the likelihood of a COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to making recommendations, TAT members provide guidance on a range of topics such as proper usage of personal protective equipment and infection control best practices.  TAT services are at no cost to the facility. What if a facility needs more assistance than a TAT can provide? If a facility may benefit from additional assistance, the TAT may recommend a follow up visit from the team along with a Certified Infection Control (CIC) professional who is typically a RN specializing in elder care.  Facilities that may still require additional assistance are referred to the Maryland Department of Health Epidemiology team. What does it mean that a TAT is non-regulatory? The role of a TAT is one of support and education whereas  MDH’s regulatory  Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) licences, certifies, and  monitors the quality of care in Maryland’s health care facilities. OHCQ is responsible for surveying facilities to determine compliance with State and federal regulations. When problems or deficiencies are noted, the OHCQ initiates administrative action against facilities. If a facility fails to correct problems and is unable or unwilling to do so, the OHCQ may impose sanctions such as license revocation, fines, bans on admission, or other restrictions on the operating license. TATs have no regulatory authority or affiliation with OHCQ. Do TATs work for OHCQ? A TAT does not work for OHCQ. The goal of a TAT is to help a facility prevent or correct problems or deficiencies related to COVID-19 prior to an OHCQ survey.  TATs and OHCQ do not coordinate site visits as OHCQ is prohibited from sharing that information.  If at any time OHCQ and a TAT find themselves at the same site at the same time, the TAT will leave the premises and reschedule the visit. Do TATs get tested following the Maryland testing policy for facilities? TAT members are tested twice a week regardless of the facility’s jurisdiction and positivity rate. How can nursing homes prepare for potential staffing shortages? Effective November 17, nursing homes must coordinate with hospital(s) in their region to ensure that the facility has adequate clinical and infection control staffing support should an outbreak occur. All nursing homes are also required to establish at least one mutual aid arrangement with another nursing home facility. Nursing homes should take the following actions to prepare for potential staffing shortages: Nursing homes are strongly encouraged to enter into, confirm, or supplement any existing staffing agreements through private staffing agencies. What is the status of “bridge teams” that support nursing home facilities? Bridge teams, now called Facility Bridge Teams, can be activated as needed. These teams were created at the end of April to provide continuity of care for residents when nursing home staffing falls below required levels due to COVID-19. A Facility Bridge team can include between two to six members per 12 hour shift per day up to four days giving the nursing home time to hire temporary staff to cover for COVID-19 positive staff during the 14-day isolation period. A team will be available to nursing home facilities through June of 2021 most likely on a fee for service basis similar to services contracted through the Chesapeake Registry. How do nursing homes register with the Chesapeake Registry and how will it benefit the facilities? Nursing facilities must now register with the Chesapeake Registry. Any facility previously registered does not need to register again. The Registry, affiliated with the Maryland Hospital Association (MHA), is a staffing resource that can quickly connect available quality supplemental staffing with employers. To register and to obtain assistance with temporary staffing, or for any questions, email covidstaffing@mhaonline.org. Registration may take up to two days to validate.  While all facilities must register, facilities are not required to use Registry staffing.  Facilities that elect to do so will be required to complete a short-term contract. How will the Chesapeake Regional Information System for Our Patients (CRISP) reporting requirements help? CRISP, Maryland’s secure health information exchange, allows nursing facilities to share data with a variety of healthcare stakeholders. Effective in April, nursing facilities must update CRISP daily to include their bed census and COVID-19 specific data. The daily sharing of this self-reported data will help to identify trends early and monitor the spread, or mitigation, of COVID-19 in nursing homes. What is the purpose of the Nursing Home Task Force and what is its current status? In April, Governor Larry Hogan convened the Nursing Home Task Force, a multi-agency team, led by the then Special Safety and Compliance Officer, Col. Eric Allely. The task force was assembled to support nursing home facilities and ensure their compliance with the ever increasing and changing COVID-19 regulations and improve communications with MDH and the public. By integrating the efforts of various state partners and MDH staff, the team supported nursing facilities to achieve universal testing, access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and meet staffing needs. Beginning in July, congregate facilities support transitioned to the Community and Facility Initiatives Director Dr. Jeffrey S. Woolford, his team, and TATs. This non-regulatory group focuses on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in these facilities. How is the state supporting facilities that need personal protective equipment (PPE)? Nursing homes and assisted living facilities can request PPE from the state by submitting a PPE Request Form. All nursing homes are required to follow the CDC’s Strategies to Optimize the Supply of PPE and Equipment.  How will vaccinations be distributed as part of Maryland’s phased vaccination plan? Maryland will distribute the vaccines to seven different priority groups based on relative risk of exposure or developing a serious illness.

Back to Top FAQs about Mental Health, Stress and Anxiety What should I do if I have an existing mental health condition? During and following an emergency, people with pre-existing mental health conditions should seek or continue treatment, following their treatment plans as set up through their provider. Individuals may experience a worsening of their symptoms; if this happens, contact your provider for additional services immediately. What if I am feeling anxious or stressed related to COVID-19? Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. The emotional impact of an emergency on a person can depend on the person’s characteristics and experiences, the social and economic circumstances of the person and their community and the availability of local resources. People can become more distressed if they excessively see repeated images or hear repeated reports about the pandemic in the media. Reactions during an infectious disease outbreak can include: Fear and worry about your own health status and that of your loved ones Changes in sleep or eating patterns Difficulty sleeping or concentrating Worsening of chronic health problems Increased use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs Feelings of fear, anxiety, sadness and uncertainty are normal during a pandemic. Fortunately, being proactive about your mental health can help to keep both your mind and body stronger. What can I do to support myself? Avoid excessive exposure to media coverage of COVID-19. Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories. It can be upsetting to hear about the crisis and see images repeatedly. Try to do some other activities you enjoy to return to your normal life. When you do read news, avoid media outlets that build hype or dwell on things that can’t be controlled. Instead, turn to information sources that provide reliable information about how to protect yourself. Recognize the things you can control. Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, meditate, and exercise. Keep yourself grounded. Try to get regular sleep and maintain a healthy diet and exercise. It is not unusual for individuals to experience disruptions in both eating and sleeping during a crisis, and it is very important to try to maintain healthy habits, and to avoid strategies such as using drugs or alcohol to handle stress. Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. Maintain healthy relationships. Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking. Stay connected. Staying at home and distancing from others should not mean you are completely isolated. Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can use the phone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others. Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime. Continue to wear your mask, maintain proper infection control techniques such as hand-washing and social distancing, and when it’s your turn, get vaccinated. Check how realistically you are viewing the situation. Avoid dramatic media and rely on credible sources of information, such as the CDC. Social media is not always a reliable source of health information. What are some of the things you can’t control? All you can do is pay attention to those things above that you can control. Worrying will merely aggravate the situation. There is some benefit to planning. But after you have a plan, move on and focus on living your life rather than worrying about the virus. Don’t try to control other people’s reactions. Listen and help people work through the facts concerning the virus but understand that hyping or denying the existence of a threat is not helpful. Call your health care provider if stress reactions interfere with your daily activities for several days in a row. Where can I find additional resources?

Children react, in part, to what they see from the adults around them. When parents and caregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children. Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better prepared. Not all children respond to stress in the same way. Some common stress-related behavior to watch for in children include: Excessive crying and irritation Returning to behaviors they have outgrown, like toileting accidents or bedwetting Excessive worry or sadness Unhealthy eating or sleeping habits Irritability and “acting out” behaviors Poor school performance or avoiding assignments Difficulty with attention and concentration Avoidance of activities enjoyed in the past Unexplained headaches or body pain Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs There are many things you can do to support your child: Take time to talk with your child about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child can understand:​ ​Stop the Spread of Rumors​. ​Limit your child’s exposure to media coverage of COVID-19. Children may misinterpret what they hear and can become frightened about something they do not understand. Reassure your child that they are safe. Let them know it is okay if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you. Help children find positive ways to express disturbing feelings such as fear and sadness. Every child has his/her own way to express emotions. Sometimes engaging in a creative activity, such as playing and drawing, can facilitate this process. Children feel relieved if they can express and communicate their disturbing feelings in a safe and supportive environment. Help your child to have a sense of structure. When it is safe to return to school or childcare, help them return to their regular activity. Be a role model; take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your friends and family members and rely on your social support system. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has more resources and information about children and anxiety. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has more information about talking to children about coronavirus (COVID-19). How should I talk to my child about the 2020/21 school year? This school year looks very different from previous years due to the pandemic and the specific measures in place to curb its spread. Talk to your child and explain the planned safety measures. Have open and honest conversations, being sure to address their fears and concerns. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has more detailed resources and information on back to school planning, including mental health and social-emotional wellbeing considerations. I’m feeling stress and anxiety about the choices in front of us. Will my children pick up on that? Yes. ​Children are “sponges” and take emotional cues from their parents and caregivers. However, it is perfectly normal to feel stress and anxiety during this time of uncertainty. If you feel immobilized by these feelings, please seek professional help through a licensed behavioral health/medical provider. It is important that parents, caregivers and teachers manage their own emotions by remaining calm, being mindful of tone, listening to the child(ren)’s concerns, and reassuring them of their safety and well-being. For Adolescents and Young Adults Everyone is worrying about the coronavirus pandemic, but everyone I know is healthy. Should I worry? Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. Adolescents and young adults often feel like nothing can go wrong. While this is normal, and can help reduce your worries, make sure you take steps to stay healthy. Recognize others may be hiding their worries in many ways. Some people become very irritable, angry and even start fights with others. Sleep and eating may become disrupted. Especially if other frightening things have happened, some youth may develop nightmares or have panic attacks. Still others may increase their use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs to escape from what is going on. What can I do to help cope? Limit your screen time. Limit your time watching, reading or listening to news stories. Avoid scrolling through your friends’ Instagram or Snap posts about illness and COVID-19. Keep yourself grounded. Exercise, meditate. Draw, write in a journal or use music to express your thoughts and feelings. Do things that make you feel good and are also good for you. Plan the things you ​can​ do: wear your mask, wash your hands, carry wet wipes or other items when you are out in public. Recognize the things you can control, like having good hygiene. Reach out to your friends and family. If you can, talk about how you are feeling. Talk about anything positive — laugh, joke. Make sure you get enough sleep and stick to your pre-COVID-19 routine as much as you can. Let someone know if you are not able to do your usual activities because of your worrying. Stay connected. Staying at home and distancing from others should not mean you are completely isolated. Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can use the phone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others. Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.

For more information about coping, check out the CDC’s Support for Teens and Young Adults. For Healthcare Workers What should I know? As a health professional, you may feel overwhelmed. As a person working with individuals who are potentially ill, you also likely have concerns about the risk of becoming infected yourself. You may also be concerned about your own financial security and family in the event of a quarantine or infection. It is important to look after yourself and maintain a balanced view of the situation. There are some things you can control, and other things that you can do nothing about. The challenge is to separate these things so that you can take reasonable steps to protect yourself, but also let go of worries and anxieties that simply get in your way. It will be important to help your clients make the same distinctions. It is important to recognize that health care workers can suffer secondary trauma as a result of their emotional involvement with distressing situations. Check in with yourself, noting if you have any symptoms of anxiety or depression. These could include sleeplessness, fatigue, irritability, depression, anger, illness, guilt and withdrawal. There are resources available online to help you cope. Please use them if you need them. Think about what you need to help yourself and those you are helping to handle the stress involved in this situation — what are some of the things you can control? Make sure you understand how your employer will address the outbreak. Remember that your reaction to the situation may not be the same as those of your colleagues or your clients. Everybody reacts differently to stressors, including those brought on by this outbreak. Respect other people’s feelings. Maintain proper infection control techniques such as wearing your mask, hand-washing and social distancing. Check how realistically you are viewing the situation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has continually pointed out that the vast majority of individuals, even if they do get sick, will not become terribly ill. Avoid dramatic media and stick to credible sources of information, such as the CDC. Social media is not a great source of information. Keep yourself grounded. Exercise, meditate. Talk to your friends on the phone. Try to get regular sleep and a healthy diet. It is not unusual for individuals to experience disruptions in both eating and sleeping during a crisis, and it is very important to try to maintain healthy habits, and to avoid strategies such as using drugs or alcohol to handle stress. What are some of the things you can’t control? Worrying will merely aggravate the situation. All you can do is pay attention to those things above that you can control. There is some benefit to planning. But after you have a plan, move on and focus on living your life rather than worrying about the virus. Don’t try to control other people’s reactions.

For Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities What are warning signs and risk factors that older adults and adults with disabilities may be experiencing emotional stress or anxiety? Older adults and adults with disabilities who are impacted by an infectious disease outbreak are faced with difficult challenges. Many older adults already struggle to maintain social connections and meaningful activities because they may not have many friends and family members nearby, they may not drive, children are grown, and they are likely retired. When asked to further limit contact with the public to reduce exposure to COVID-19, they may experience increased loneliness and isolation. Additionally, many older adults and adults with disabilities are reliant on help from family, friends or paid caregivers. Fear of not having access to this care if the caregiver becomes sick can cause stress and anxiety. Warnings signs of stress may include: Difficulty concentrating on daily activities Loss of interest in daily activities Crying spells, irritability or bursts of anger Difficulty eating Sleep problems, like difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or sleeping too much Increasing physical distress symptoms such as headaches, stomach pains or restlessness Increased fatigue Feeling guilty, helpless or hopeless Older adults and adults with disabilities most at risk of experiencing severe emotional stress or anxiety include those with a history of: Exposure to other traumas, including severe accidents, abuse, assault, combat or rescue work Chronic medical illness or psychological disorders Chronic poverty, homelessness, or discrimination Those who lost a loved one or friend involved in an infectious disease outbreak Those who lack economic stability and/or knowledge of the English language Older adults who may lack mobility or independence Older adults who rely upon others for daily assistance What can older adults and adults with disabilities do to reduce emotional stress and anxiety? Avoid excessive exposure to media coverage of COVID-19 Only consult legitimate sources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for information about COVID-19 Engage in activities that bring comfort or joy Take deep breaths, stretch or meditate Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep and avoid alcohol and drugs Make time to unwind and remember that strong feelings will fade Share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member Call your health care provider if stress reactions interfere with your daily activities for several days in a row Avoid making major life decisions Be especially aware of scams related to COVID-19. The Federal Trade Commission has identified several of them and is offering tips to protect yourself and others: ​Coronavirus Advice for Consumers​.  Back to Top FAQs about Isolation and Quarantine What is the difference between quarantine and isolation? Isolation​ is the separation of people with COVID-19 from others. People in isolation need to stay home and separate themselves from others as much as possible. Sharing food, utensils, bathroom facilities and sleeping quarters, as well as contact with pets, should be avoided. Quarantine​ is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. These people may or may not get sick. People in quarantine should stay home as much as possible for 14 days, limit their contact with other people, and monitor themselves closely for symptoms of COVID-19. Most people who are going to get sick will get sick within 2-14 days of exposure. While 14 days is the recommended length of quarantine, there are options to reduce the length of quarantine. In most instances, people without symptoms can end quarantine after day 10 without testing or after day 7 after receiving a negative test result. In addition, those who have been fully vaccinated and have no symptoms may not need to quarantine.  If quarantine is ended before the full 14 days, people should continue to monitor for symptoms and practice other preventive behaviors (e.g., mask use) through day 14. Who needs to quarantine? People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months and asymptomatic people who have been fully vaccinated in the past 3 months. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again. People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms. What counts as close contact? Close contact is described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as being within 6 feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to test specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated. Cumulative total can be determined by adding individual exposures over a 24-hour period (e.g., three 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes). I just tested positive for COVID-19. What do I do? Follow your healthcare provider’s guidance. Most people can recover at home. It is important that you stay home and take care of yourself. Stay away, or isolate, from others as much as you can. Read the CDC guidance on ​What to Do if You are Sick​. Do not have visitors, unless they are caring for you. You should also answer the call from contact tracers who will check in on your health and ask you some questions to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Answer and/or return any calls from “MD COVID.” If you do not have caller ID on your phone, look for the phone number (240) 466-4488. Please follow the guidelines they provide on the call. When is it safe to resume normal activities after I have been in isolation? Most people with symptoms of COVID can follow the CDC’s three conditions before being around others: *Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation. If you tested positive but have no symptoms and you continue to be well, you can be with others after 10 days after testing positive. When around others, remember to stay six feet apart and wear a face covering. This guidance is subject to change. Talk to your health care provider especially if you have a high-risk underlying health condition or if you are 65 years and older. You may need to stay away from other people longer. When is it safe to resume normal activities after I have been in quarantine? While 14 days is the recommended length of quarantine, there are options to reduce the length of quarantine. In most instances, people without symptoms can end quarantine after day 10 without testing or after day 7 after receiving a negative test result. If quarantine is ended before the full 14 days, people should continue to monitor for symptoms and practice other preventive behaviors (e.g., mask use) through day 14. If you remain symptom-free, it is usually safe to resume normal activities when 14 days have passed since your last contact with someone with COVID-19. Will my positive COVID-19 test results be reported to anyone? Yes. Under Maryland law, positive COVID-19 test results will be reported to the Maryland Department of Health and local Health Department. However, your information will not be shared with the public, or in contact tracing investigations with people who may have had close contact with you. See ​covidLINK​. What symptoms require medical attention right away? Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency care provider if you have: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face Let 911 or the provider know you have COVID-19. This will help them know how to care for you and keep other people from getting infected. How can I protect my family or caregivers while recovering from COVID-19 at home? Try to stay away from others as much as possible. Try to stay in one room and, if you can, don’t use the same bathroom as them. When around others, wear a face covering and have them wear one too. Everyone should wash their hands often. Avoid sharing anything like dishes, towels, or bedding. Make sure all high touch areas are disinfected every day. See ​Caring for Someone Sick at Home. Caregiver Tips: Wash hands often. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Shared spaces in the home should have good air flow. If you can, open a window or use a fan. This will help remove COVID-19 respiratory droplets from the air. Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient, especially when you have contact with their blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine. Wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Keep soiled items away from your body. Wash laundry thoroughly. When removing gloves and mask, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then, wash your hands right away. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and wash your hands again. Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse. Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined trash can. Wash your hands at once after handling these items. Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other animals while sick. For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals. I was already vaccinated; do I still need to isolate or quarantine? Fully vaccinated persons who meet the following criteria may no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19: Fully vaccinated (2 or more weeks following the second dose in a 2-dose series, or 2 or more weeks following one dose of a single-dose vaccine) Within 90 days following the last dose in the series Have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID-19 exposure Anyone who does not meet all three of the criteria should continue to follow current quarantine guidance after exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals who do not quarantine should still watch for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be tested for COVID-19. Vaccinated inpatients and residents in healthcare settings should continue to quarantine following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. CDC’s updated guidance for quarantine and isolation can be found here. All fully vaccinated persons who do not quarantine should also continue to: Follow all recommendations regarding facial coverings, social distancing, and other COVID-19 precautions; and Watch for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, if indicated. Do I have to quarantine if I have already had COVID-19? People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms. People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms. Back to Top FAQs about Telehealth How does telehealth work? Telehealth uses technology to allow patients and providers in separate locations to have a real time virtual office visit. The technology can include audio-video conferencing services, video chat using FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, Zoom or Skype, or a telephone-only call. What are the changes to telehealth to address COVID-19? Temporary changes to telehealth regulations include allowing a patient to receive telehealth services in their own home or any other private location as agreed upon by you and your health care provider. Another is to allow telephone-only telehealth “visits.” How do I get a telehealth appointment? You can contact your health care provider to schedule a telehealth visit like you would an office visit. You may also check with your insurer. What should I do to get ready for a telehealth visit? Write down your questions Make a list of your symptoms Note when your symptoms started and if they have changed Be ready to verify your identity Be ready to talk to your provider from a quiet, private place Consider trying a “visit” with someone else using the same device and location for your telehealth visit to assure everything works Be ready and able to answer when your provider calls for your scheduled telehealth visit Your provider may call from a number other than their office. Caller ID may show “Unknown Caller,” “Private,” “Blocked” or “No Caller ID.” Be sure to answer the call at your appointment time. Is telehealth secure? Privacy and security depend on the service or video chat that you and your provider use. Your provider must explain the telehealth service to you and any privacy or security limitations. Are there any apps that providers should not use for a telehealth visit? You should not use an app that is public facing like Facebook Live, Twitch or TikTok. These apps do not protect your privacy. Do telehealth services have any consent requirements? Your provider must get your consent for telehealth services and note it in your medical record. You may give verbal consent. A parent or guardian may give consent. Are all telehealth services available by telephone only? A provider can evaluate medical devices, refer you to health care services, provide treatment and issue most prescriptions. However, some services are not eligible for telephone-only telehealth. Some examples of services that are not eligible for telephone only visits include physical therapy services, occupational therapy services and speech language services. Ask your insurer or provider what services are available. Where can I find information on my insurer’s telehealth options? You can use the links below to visit each insurers website for more information about telehealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Or, call the number on your member ID card.

Skip table of contents Table of Contents  View transcript  of Trust the Facts, Get the Vax - English  Vaccines are safe and are one of the best ways to protect yourself and those around you from getting sick from COVID-19.  The vaccine doesn’t contain the virus that causes COVID-19, so it can’t make you sick. You may experience mild side effects after getting the vaccine, but this is a sign that your body is learning how to protect you. Massachusetts has started to vaccinate against COVID-19. Here are a few important things to know: The vaccine is free free Anyone who lives, works, or studies in Massachusetts can get a vaccine  lives, works, or studies You can get vaccinated even if you are undocumented. Getting a vaccine will not impact you or your family’s immigration status. The Public Charge rule does NOT apply to getting the vaccine. Right now supplies are severely limited, so Massachusetts is prioritizing who gets the vaccine first. The timeline is made up of 3 phases and prioritized by groups within each phase. The timeline reflects several priorities: Protecting our most vulnerable residents Maintaining health care system capacity Addressing inequities in health care access and focusing on communities with the highest COVID-19 burden  Vaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. The COVID-19 vaccine will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.  The vaccine will help protect you by teaching your body how to recognize and fight the virus. The vaccine can help keep you from getting COVID-19, but even if you do get the virus, it can keep you from getting very sick. Two approved COVID-19 vaccines, one from Moderna and one from Pfizer – are given in two doses, about three weeks apart. You need both doses to be fully protected. A third vaccine – Johnson & Johnson – requires only a single dose to be protected.  two doses You need both doses to be fully protected. It takes a few weeks after the second dose to become fully protected. You may have a sore arm, aches, fatigue, or fever for a few days after getting the vaccine. These symptoms are a sign that your immune system is learning how to protect you from the virus. COVID-19 vaccines available in Massachusetts are made by three companies: Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen. These vaccines were authorized by the Federal Food and Drug Administration only after they were shown to be safe and effective in studies (called clinical trials). Moderna Pfizer Johnson & Johnson/Janssen The U.S. ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines In Massachusetts, a group of infectious disease experts reviewed the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. This workgroup confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA are safe and effective. confirmed We understand the importance of being open and honest about the safety and development of the vaccine— especially for communities who have suffered consequences of medical mistreatment. The COVID-19 vaccine was developed quickly but all of the same safety steps were followed for this vaccine that are used for all vaccines.  Vaccine companies moved quickly because:  They used existing research and information on coronavirus: COVID-19 is part of a family of viruses that has been studied for a long time. The vaccine developers used this existing research to help develop the COVID-19 vaccine.  They used existing research and information on coronavirus: Governments funded vaccine research: The United States and other governments invested a lot of money to help vaccine companies with their work. Working together with other countries also helped researchers move quickly. Governments funded vaccine research: Tens of thousands of people participated in vaccine studies: Studies of the vaccine (called Clinical Trials) were conducted to prove the vaccine is safe and effective. Tens of thousands of people signed up for the studies, so companies did not need to spend a lot of time finding volunteers. Tens of thousands of people participated in vaccine studies: Manufacturing happened at the same time as the safety studies: Vaccine companies started making the vaccine at the same time as studies were happening in hopes that it would be proven safe and effective. This meant vaccines were ready to be distributed once they were approved.  Manufacturing happened at the same time as the safety studies: Since the vaccines were approved, millions of people of different races and ethnicities have been vaccinated, and most have only experienced mild side effects. millions of people of different races and ethnicities have been vaccinated  Example COVID-19 vaccine timeline:  Example COVID-19 vaccine timeline:   Traditional timeline: Traditional timeline:   Find out when & where you can get the COVID-19 vaccine Read more about vaccine safety and side effects View all videos: Trust the Facts, Get the Vax View all videos: Trust the Facts, Get the Vax  Check your eligibility Check your eligibility  View COVID-19 vaccination locations View COVID-19 vaccination locations  Prepare for your appointment Prepare for your appointment  Read COVID-19 vaccine FAQs Read COVID-19 vaccine FAQs  See all Massachusetts COVID-19 vaccine information See all Massachusetts COVID-19 vaccine information  View all videos: Trust the Facts, Get the Vax View all videos: Trust the Facts, Get the Vax  Check your eligibility Check your eligibility  View COVID-19 vaccination locations View COVID-19 vaccination locations  Prepare for your appointment Prepare for your appointment  Read COVID-19 vaccine FAQs Read COVID-19 vaccine FAQs  See all Massachusetts COVID-19 vaccine information See all Massachusetts COVID-19 vaccine information  Feedback We will use this information to improve the site.

The amount of vaccine doses available to states from the federal government is growing every week. However, we will not get all the doses we need all at once. The goal for Minnesota’s COVID-19 vaccine doses is to immunize for impact – meaning we are first offering vaccine to those at highest risk of getting COVID-19 and those most at risk of severe disease and complications if they get COVID-19. For more information, including who can get vaccinated now, see Stay Safe MN: Who's Getting Vaccinated. Stay Safe MN: Who's Getting Vaccinated Where to get vaccinated Minnesota has several large-scale community vaccination sites. These COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program sites will vaccinate people in eligible groups. COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program In addition to these sites, the state is sending doses of COVID-19 vaccine to more than 100 hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers to administer vaccines to Minnesotans. Minnesotans can use the online vaccine locator map to Find Vaccine Locations near them and contact those health care providers with questions. Please note that vaccine supply is still limited, so appointments may not always be available. Find Vaccine Locations People who can get vaccinated because of where they work may also be contacted by their employers to get vaccinated.

Insurance and identification are not needed, and signing up is free. Who decides who will get vaccinated The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) makes recommendations on who should get the vaccine. MDH has brought together the Minnesota COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Advisory Group to help us make sure we are fairly and strategically making decisions for how vaccine should be distributed. The advisory group is made up of external partners who represent key populations in the state, such as local public health, long-term care, pharmacy partners, diverse communities, and more. The final decisions about how to distribute COVID-19 vaccine ultimately come from Governor Tim Walz. Find their guidance for prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine at COVID-19 Vaccine Phases and Planning. Minnesota COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Advisory Group COVID-19 Vaccine Phases and Planning If you have had COVID-19 You should get vaccinated even if you have had COVID-19 disease. We are not sure how long protection from a COVID-19 infection might last. If you have an opportunity to get vaccinated after you have had COVID-19, you can do so after you have completed your isolation period. This means it has been 10 days since you felt sick (or 10 days since you got tested if you do not have symptoms), and you feel better and have not have a fever for at least 24 hours. You do not have to get tested before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Who can and can't get the vaccine At this time, the available COVID-19 vaccines are for adults; the Pfizer vaccine allows vaccination of people 16 years and older and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccines allow vaccination for people 18 years and older. This includes people with medical conditions, who have had COVID-19, and those of different ages, races, and ethnicities. The vaccine is safe for people who may want to have a baby one day. Please see the section below, ""considerations for special populations,"" for people who are pregnant and those with weak immune systems. There are few reasons that someone should not get vaccinated. A person that had a life-threatening reaction to a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine should not receive any further doses of that type of vaccine. Additionally, if a person has had a life-threatening reaction to any ingredient in the vaccine, they should not get that vaccine. They may want to talk to an allergy specialist. People who have had anaphylaxis (an immune response of the body that causes someone to go into shock) after taking other medicines, particularly medicines given by injection, may be vaccinated but should be observed for 30 minutes after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. There have been reports of some serious allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions like this are known to happen after taking medicines or getting vaccinated, but they are still very rare. CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are working to understand what might be causing this. Clinics are prepared to respond quickly to adverse reactions. You will be asked to wait 15-30 minutes after you have been vaccinated so that clinic staff can observe you, this will likely be in a place that allows for social distancing. Considerations for special populations It is important to know that for some populations, we don't have much information about safety or how well the vaccine works, or it hasn't been studied yet. In these circumstances, people may be vaccinated but should speak with their health care provider so they understand what is known about their situation and vaccination. People under 18 years old At this time, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine that has been studied and authorized for use by people ages 16 and 17. Other vaccine manufacturers are also studying their vaccines in younger age groups but have not yet received authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine for People Ages 16 and 17 (PDF) Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine for People Ages 16 and 17 (PDF) Pregnant people People who are breastfeeding mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. A person who is breastfeeding who is part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., health care workers) may choose to be vaccinated. Immunocompromised people Immunocompromised means a person has a weak immune system. People with HIV infection, other immunocompromising conditions, or who take medications or therapies that weaken the immune system might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. We currently do not have data on vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups. People with a weak immune system who want to receive COVID-19 vaccine should be informed that there is little information about how effective or how safe the vaccine is. These people may not have a strong immune response to the vaccine (they may have less protection), so they should continue to follow guidance to protect themselves from COVID-19. Getting vaccinated Doses of COVID-19 vaccine Some COVID-19 vaccines require one dose and some require two doses. Your health care provider will let you know which vaccine you are getting. If you get the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine, you only need one dose. You do not need to make a second appointment. Two doses are needed for the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. The time between the doses depends on the vaccine you are getting. The Pfizer vaccine (ultra-cold vaccine) should be given 21 days (three weeks) apart and the Moderna vaccine (frozen vaccine) should be given 28 days apart (one month). Second dose for two-dose COVID-19 vaccines It is very important that someone gets both vaccine doses, the same product for each dose, and that the doses are given at the correct time apart. The vaccine works best after two doses. If someone only gets one dose, they may not be as well protected against COVID-19. If it has been longer than 21 or 28 days (depending on which vaccine product you got) before you get your second dose, try to get your second dose as soon as you can. The second dose boosts your immunity to COVID-19 and will help even if it is a longer time between shots. Even if it is beyond the recommended amount of time (21 or 28 days), go get your second dose. You will not have to start over. We recommend that you schedule an appointment for your second dose when you get the first dose. You should receive a card with the date you were vaccinated. Write the return date for your second dose on the vaccination card and put a reminder in your phone or calendar.

We do not know if taking these medicines before getting vaccinated could impact how the vaccine works. Taking pain medication after getting the shot is OK if you have side effects. Information collected When you get your COVID-19 vaccine, you will be asked to share your full name, date of birth, address, phone number, and gender. You will never be asked about your immigration status when getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Getting vaccinated will not impact your eligibility to gain lawful permanent residence status (green card). You will not be identified as a public charge. The person who gives you the vaccine is required to enter vaccine data into Minnesota's immunization information system, the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC), so that MDH can get the information. MIIC keeps track of someone's vaccination history and makes sure they get the right vaccinations at the right time. Find more information on MIIC at About MIIC. MIIC collects name, date of birth, address, phone number, and various information related the vaccination itself (administration date, vaccine type, lot number, etc.). MDH shares de-identified vaccine data with the federal government (CDC) every day. This means that the data could not be traced back to a specific person. MDH does not share any information with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). About MIIC Proof of vaccination COVID-19 vaccine providers are required to enter vaccine data into Minnesota's immunization information system, the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC). You will also be given a card after your vaccination with the date you were vaccinated. It may be helpful to keep the card handy in case you are asked about which vaccine you received. We do not know how or if any documentation of vaccination will be used for participation in social activities, gatherings, travel, etc. Other vaccines It is recommended that a person should wait 14 days before or after COVID-19 vaccination to receive a vaccine for other diseases, like flu vaccine. Residency You do not have to be a resident of Minnesota to get vaccinated here. Cost/insurance COVID-19 vaccine will be provided to people at no cost. However, health care providers will be able to charge an administration fee to insurance companies for giving the vaccine to someone. This means that you might be asked for your insurance information when you get the COVID-19 vaccine. You can still get the COVID-19 vaccine if you do not have insurance and/or cannot pay the administration fee. No one should receive a bill for the vaccine or administration fee.

Federal Trade Commission: FTC Issues Consumer Tips for Avoiding COVID-19 Vaccine Scams After getting the vaccine Immunity after vaccination After your final COVID-19 vaccine dose, it takes about two weeks for your body to build up protection. After those two weeks, you have good protection against illness for yourself. However, we’re still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. It is important to continue to follow all public health guidance to reduce the spread of COVID-19 even after you have been fully vaccinated. CDC: Symptoms of Coronavirus Travel During COVID-19 At this time, we do not know if this will be a vaccine that people need to get again, like needing a tetanus shot every 10 years or getting a flu shot every year. Sick from COVID-19 after vaccination The COVID-19 vaccine cannot give you COVID-19 disease. The vaccine does not provide instant and complete protection. It takes about two weeks after getting fully vaccinated for your body to build up protection from COVID-19 disease. You could be exposed during this time. Although your protection is pretty good after those two weeks, there is still a small chance you could become infected with COVID-19 and develop symptoms. If you do get sick, it is likely that your symptoms will be milder than if you didn't get vaccinated. While the available vaccines have been shown to be very effective at preventing COVID-19 illness in those who are vaccinated, we are still learning to what degree the vaccine may prevent someone who is vaccinated from passing along the virus to other people. Someone who is vaccinated might be exposed to COVID-19 but have no symptoms. We do not know if that person could still spread COVID-19 to others and not know it. We are also still learning how long protection from the vaccine lasts. This is why it is important for everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to continue to follow other public health recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19: wear a mask, stay 6 feet from others, wash your hands often, and stay home if sick. We will continue to evaluate these recommendations as more people in the community get vaccinated and we see how this impacts spread of disease. Vaccine side effects versus COVID-19 symptoms Some side effects are common after vaccination. They are a result of your body responding to the vaccine (it's also OK if you don't have any side effects at all). Common side effects from the vaccine can include pain, swelling, or redness where the shot was given, and sometimes feeling achy and tired. Some people may have a headache or fever. Some side effects can be the same or similar as symptoms of COVID-19 or other illnesses. The COVID-19 vaccine cannot give you COVID-19 disease. For example, these conditions after vaccination could be from the vaccine or other illness: Other symptoms are less likely to be side effects of the vaccine but are signs of possible illness. If you have any of the below symptoms, you should get tested for COVID-19 and other illnesses as recommended by your health care provider: Serious adverse events A serious adverse event is something that is life-threatening. Most adverse effects occur in the six weeks after getting a vaccine. If you have a severe reaction, contact your health care provider. Providers should report severe reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This reporting system helps the CDC and FDA continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) V-safe CDC has also launched a new patient reporting tool for COVID-19 vaccine. It is a smartphone app called v-safe. This app can help with active monitoring for COVID-19 vaccine safety after you get the COVID-19 vaccine. Your health care provider will give you more information on v-safe. You can learn more at V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker and access an information sheet and flyers in multiple languages at V-safe Print Resources. V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker V-safe Print Resources Going to work or school when you have side effects Side effects can happen after vaccination and can be similar to symptoms of illnesses, like COVID-19. These side effects can include pain, swelling, or redness where the shot was given. Less common side effects can include headache, fatigue, or fever. Managing discomfort after vaccination Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or ibuprofen are effective in managing vaccine side effects including pain where the shot was given, body aches, and fever after you get vaccinated. Cool cloths may relieve the swelling or pain at the injection site. Move or exercise your arm. For fully vaccinated people Quarantine, masks, and social distance after vaccination If you have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and it has been at least 2 weeks since the final dose of vaccine (enough time for your body to develop immunity), you have good protection against illness for yourself. However, we’re still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. So, it is important to follow the recommendations below when visiting an unvaccinated person or a household with anyone at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. If you’ve been fully vaccinated (two doses in a two-dose series or one dose in a one-dose series): CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions It is still important to: CDC: Symptoms of Coronavirus Travel During COVID-19 If someone is fully vaccinated and is exposed, they do not need to quarantine if ALL of the following are true: People who live or work in a health care or long-term care facility, have been vaccinated, and have a COVID-19 exposure should refer to COVID-19 Recommendations for Health Care Workers (PDF). COVID-19 Recommendations for Health Care Workers (PDF) To get COVID-19 under control, it is important to continue to follow public health guidance to reduce the spread of COVID-19 even after you have been vaccinated. We will continue to evaluate these recommendations as more people in the community get vaccinated and we see how this impacts spread of disease. Gatherings after vaccination When you and those you might get together with are all vaccinated, it is likely that the risk of spreading the disease to each other is small. If you've been fully vaccinated: CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions Remember, Minnesota still has a face covering requirement. This means there are some places that you are required to wear a face covering and it does not include exemptions for vaccinated people. Under Executive Order 20-81, people are required to wear face coverings in certain public spaces. For more information about face covering requirements and recommendations under Executive Order 20-81, visit Face Covering Requirements and Recommendations. Face Covering Requirements and Recommendations We will continue to evaluate these recommendations as more people in the community get vaccinated and we see how this impacts spread of disease. Available vaccines Authorized vaccines There have been three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine FDA: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine FDA: Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine An EUA is used in public health emergencies when: A product shows that it likely works, is safe but hasn't yet gone through the whole process of FDA licensure, and no other remedy is available. You have the right to refuse or accept the COVID-19 vaccine, as stated in the EUA fact sheets. We strongly encourage you to get the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available to you. Getting the vaccine will help protect you and your family, co-workers, residents, patients, and community. Several other COVID-19 vaccines are in development. They are going through different studies and checks (called clinical trials) to make sure they are safe, and that they work, before they are given to the public. Protection against variant strains We are still learning about new variants. While the COVID-19 vaccines may not work as well against some of the variant strains, scientists think the vaccines will still offer some protection against most COVID-19 variants. Choosing between different COVID-19 vaccines At this point, the data between the COVID-19 vaccines look very similar. There are not recommendations for certain populations (e.g., older people or people with immune disorders, etc.) to get one vaccine over the other. Currently, most vaccination sites and health care providers in Minnesota only have one COVID-19 vaccine product, so people will probably not have a choice of which vaccine they get. You can refuse to get vaccinated, but another vaccine appointment cannot be guaranteed right now while vaccine supply remains low. What the vaccines are made of The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were made using mRNA technology. mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid. mRNA is not able to alter or modify a person's genetic makeup (DNA).

The adenovirus is grown using what is called an immortalized cell line, and the virus then is pulled out and purified. The cell line came from a legal abortion that occurred in 1985. This cell line has been maintained by Johnson & Johnson for decades to make life-saving vaccines and other medical products. The cells today are clones of the early cells, not the original tissue. There is not fetal tissue in the vaccine. Many faith groups and bioethics institutes have stated that people may ethically receive these vaccines when there is not an alternative vaccine.

The manufacturers must present the study data that shows the vaccine is safe and that it works before it is approved for general populations. This data is closely reviewed by several scientific groups at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and other groups look at available information about a vaccine and make informed decisions about the risks and benefits of using it.

The companies making the vaccines have to share information with specific agencies like the FDA and CDC that shows how the vaccine studies were designed, what their process was, how they got their data, and what the results were. Health officials, FDA, vaccine manufacturers, and others have committed to only put out vaccines that are shown to be safe. The FDA has given guidance to vaccine manufacturers about what information is needed to prove that a vaccine is safe and that the vaccine works. For more details about expectations and commitments, see: Statement about COVID-19 vaccine planning The FDA's Scientific and Regulatory Oversight of Vaccines is Vital to Public Health Biopharma Leaders Unit to Stand with Science An Open letter to the Biopharmaceutical Industry (PDF) Learn more about how vaccines are made from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at Making Vaccines. Making Vaccines The CDC has more information on COVID-19 vaccine safety at Ensuring the Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States. Ensuring the Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States Who is in the vaccine studies Pregnant people and children The first vaccine studies are usually done with groups that are at highest risk for the disease, or who will get very sick if they get the disease. Then the studies are expanded to other groups such as pregnant people and people who are immunocompromised (cannot easily fight off a disease). For COVID-19 vaccine, studies focused on non-pregnant adults ages 18 years and older at first (16 years and older for Pfizer). Vaccine manufacturers have started expanding to pregnant people and some children as they get more data from the first part of their studies. Diverse and underserved communities The COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials include people from diverse communities. It is important for these studies to have equitably more people from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. This way they have enough information to be confident that the vaccine is safe and works for these groups. It's especially important that COVID-19 vaccine trials include people from diverse communities, because these communities have been severely impacted by the disease and could greatly benefit from getting vaccinated. How a vaccine helps Why we need a vaccine We will start to get back to the activities we love, open up business and schools, and scale back our public health prevention measures, such as masking and social distancing. Vaccination is how we will end the pandemic. What about herd immunity Herd immunity is also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or social immunity. This is when most people in a population or group are immune to a disease. Being immune means they cannot get the disease because either they got a vaccine, or they already had the disease and cannot get it again, at least for a while. When a lot of people cannot get the disease, it helps to protect other people in the population who are not immune and can get the disease. Having herd immunity can stop or slow the spread of disease. We cannot let herd immunity happen naturally, at the cost of thousands of Minnesotans getting very sick and possibly dying. Vaccination is a way to reach herd immunity without people getting sick and/or dying. Vaccination lets a person's body develop protection against a disease without having to actually get sick. More information What you can do now We are glad so many people want to get vaccinated and know that waiting for vaccine is extremely hard right now. Vaccine is constantly being made and distributed. Everyone's opportunity to get vaccinated will come; it will just take some time. You can do your part now by continuing to help slow the spread of COVID-19: Wear a mask, wash your hands often, stay 6 feet away from other people, and stay home if you are sick. Doing all of these things will help keep people healthy until a vaccine is widely available. You can also get a flu vaccine. While the flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19, it can save lives and prevent more illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. To find where you can get a flu vaccine, call your health care provider.

"MO","Get the Facts Is this a hoax? Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? If I've already had COVID-19 should I get vaccinated? What does the vaccine do? vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to encourage your cells to initiate an Janssen’s vaccine uses a vector (carrier) to provide our cells The vector used in Janssen’s vaccine is a harmless adenovirus (like the common cold) To learn more about vector technology, You rely on proteins every day to keep your body healthy. Vaccines that use mRNA are typically quicker and easier to produce, which has helped accelerate the COVID-19 vaccine process. The ingredients used in the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna are simple. Although FDA approved adjuvants (aluminum salts) and preservatives (ethlymercury) have a history of safe use in vaccines,  Safety How do I know that a COVID-19 vaccine will be safe? Millions of Americans have received a both doses of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, As an additional layer of checks and balances, an external advisory board made up of medical vaccine data and recommended the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines be made America’s best medical and research professionals have been working for years on coronavirus coronavirus family. The lessons learned through those developments are being applied today. Clinical trials are an important part of determining vaccine safety and efficacy. tens of thousands of participants. The purpose of clinical trials is to review and base their recommendations on. If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly study it further to assess vaccine recommendations. This monitoring is critical to help ensure that the benefits continue  How did we get a vaccine for COVID-19 so fast? Although the timeline has been accelerated, it doesn’t mean we skipped the integrity of the trial and approval processes. Scientists have had a jump on developing the COVID-19 vaccine, using their experience from previous coronavirus vaccine efforts. Another way scientists preserved safety and saved time was by working on efforts simultaneously, rather than one after another like the traditional process. For example, COVID-19 vaccines were in Phase III clinical trials at the same time they were being manufactured. When it was proven safe and effective, the manufactured vaccines were deployed. If the vaccines don’t pass the approval process, which is verified by an independent committee of health experts, the unproven vaccines won’t be used. Can you get this vaccine if you are in quarantine due to an exposure with a positive COVID-19 case? You should delay your vaccination if you have had a known SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19) exposure until your quarantine period has ended, unless residing in a congregate setting (health care/long-term care facility, correctional facility, homeless shelter, etc.). Should you have a pregnancy test or antibody test prior to receiving the vaccine? Routine testing for pregnancy or antibody tests is not recommended in relation to vaccine use. Can you get the flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time? There is no information on co-administration of this COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines. Do I have to get the same vaccine for the first and second doses? Yes, patients must receive the same vaccine for both the first and second doses of Pfizer or Moderna. Your vaccination provider will give you a vaccine card stating the manufacturer name and other critical information you will need for a second dose. Who is not recommended for the COVID-19 vaccines? Pfizer’s vaccine was approved for those age 16 and older. Moderna and Janssen's vaccines have been approved for those 18 and older. (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a prior dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of its components. For information on vaccine components, refer to the manufacturers’ package inserts Moderna, What ingredients are used in the COVID-19 vaccines? The ingredients used in the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna are simple. Ingredients of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine include: recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HBCD), polysorbate-80, sodium chloride. they were not used by Pfizer, Moderna or Janssen. What are the possible side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine? Among vaccine recipients during the Pfizer clinical trials, 8.8% reported experiencing any reaction muscle pain (1.8%), chills (1.7%), and injection site pain (1.4%). Of note, more people experienced these Among vaccine recipients during the Moderna clinical trials, common being including fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches and pains. Additionally, no specific safety concerns were identified for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? No. Every day, a healthy immune system successfully fights off thousands of germs. Antigens are parts of germs that cause the body’s immune system to go to work to build antibodies, which fight off diseases. The antigens in vaccines come from the germs themselves, but the germs are weakened or killed so they cannot cause serious illness. Even if people receive several vaccinations in one day, vaccines contain only a tiny fraction of the antigens they encounter every day in their environment. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to fight off serious vaccine-preventable diseases. Who was represented in the clinical trials? Pfizer’s clinical trial enrolled 44,000+ participants with 42% globally having racially and ethnically diverse communities, including 6,000 Hispanic and 3,000 Black participants. Latin America and South Africa.  AstraZeneca’s initial trial data included conduct trials in South Africa, Kenya, Latin America, Japan, Russia and the United States. Should I continue to wear a mask, social distance, maintain good hygiene, and avoid large gatherings? According to the CDC, people are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 ≥2 weeks after they have received the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or ≥2 weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen ).† Fully vaccinated people can: Visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing For now, fully vaccinated people shoudl continue to: Wear masks, practice physical distancing, and adhere to other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease or who have an unvaccinated household member who is at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease Avoid medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings Follow guidance issued by individual employers Updated on March 24, 2021. To ensure you are viewing the latest federal guidance, please click here. The CDC guidance will be updated and expanded based on the level of community spread of SARS-CoV-2, the proportion of the population that is fully vaccinated, and the rapidly evolving science on COVID-19 vaccines. Do you still have to quarantine as a close contact after you receive both doses of the vaccine? According to the CDC, people are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 ≥2 weeks after they have received the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or ≥2 weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen ).† Fully vaccinated people can: Visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing For now, fully vaccinated people shoudl continue to: Wear masks, practice physical distancing, and adhere to other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease or who have an unvaccinated household member who is at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease Avoid medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings Follow guidance issued by individual employers Updated on March 24, 2021.

The CDC guidance will be updated and expanded based on the level of community spread of SARS-CoV-2, the proportion of the population that is fully vaccinated, and the rapidly evolving science on COVID-19 vaccines. Is it safe to get my child vaccinated? The initial clinical trials did not include children. Pfizer’s vaccine has been authorized for emergency use to vaccinate those ages 18 and up. Is it safe for pregnant women to get vaccinated? Yes, pregnant females are recommended for the vaccines depending on the individual’s risk of acquisition due to the level of community transmission, personal risk of contracting COVID-19 due to occupation or other activities, risks of COVID-19 to the mother and potential risks to the fetus, efficacy of the vaccine, known side effects of the vaccine and the lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy. Special counseling and a 15-minute observation period after vaccination, if chosen, is recommended. How are vaccinators vetted? Do they have to have medical experience? Why are medical professionals optimistic about this vaccine? According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the overwhelming majority of people who are infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, recover. That means most patients’ immune response that’s adequate to suppress the virus and eliminate it from their body. That gives medical professionals confidence that a vaccine could initiate a similar response. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the overwhelming majority of people who are infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, recover. That means most patients’ immune response that’s adequate to suppress the virus and eliminate it from their body. That gives medical professionals confidence that a vaccine could initiate a similar response.  We also had a jumpstart on the development of this vaccine. America’s best medical and research professionals have been working for years on coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS. SARS and MERS are different than SARS-CoV-2 but belong to the coronavirus family. The lessons learned through those developments are being applied today. Specifically, the effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine began months ago. Efficacy Can I take over-the-counter pain relievers before my vaccination appointment? At this time, the CDC does not recommend taking pain relievers before a COVID-19 vaccination appointment because there is not enough information to determine the impact the medications may have on the immune response. However, they may be used post-vaccination to ease discomfort.

However, they may be used post-vaccination to ease discomfort.      If you have been vaccinated, can you stop from using other precautions? No. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others. how to protect yourself and others it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations for Most people recover. Why do I need a vaccine? COVID-19 is a deadly disease that causes severe illness – and in some cases, long term symptoms that we have yet to fully understand. The COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been created to decrease death and severe illness. COVID-19 is a deadly disease that causes severe illness – and in some cases, long term symptoms that we have yet to fully understand. The COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been created to decrease death and severe illness. Although a high percentage of people recover from COVID-19, some are hospitalized and experience severe illness. It is also somewhat common to have the virus but never experience symptoms, and it is possible to spread the virus to others even when symptoms are not present. When you make the choice to be vaccinated, you are protecting not only you but also those around you from the chance of death and severe illness caused by COVID-19. How effective will a COVID-19 vaccine be? Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have an approximate 95% efficacy rate and are highly effective in preventing severe disease. In December, the CDC published that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had a constant efficacy rate across age, sex and ethnicity categories, as well as among individuals with underlying medical conditions and those who have been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, initial clinical data showed protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the Pfizer vaccine, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. AstraZeneca estimates a 90% efficacy rate from a specific 2-dose schedule. death caused by SARS-CoV-2.

In December, the CDC published that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had a constant efficacy rate across age, sex and ethnicity categories, as well as among individuals with underlying medical conditions and those who have been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, initial clinical data showed protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the Pfizer vaccine, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. According to Moderna's website, initial trial data was used to estimate a vaccine efficacy of 94.5%. Initial data from Moderna also shows the vaccine may provide some protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. AstraZeneca estimates a 90% efficacy rate from a specific 2-dose schedule. Janssen’s clinical trials showed an 85% efficacy rate in preventing hospitalization and complete protection against All authorized vaccines are highly effective. The different types of vaccines were not studied in head-to-head comparisons or trials; therefore, they should not be compared to each other. Does the vaccine prevent against asymptomatic infection? Initial data from Moderna shows the vaccine may provide some protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial data from Moderna shows the vaccine may provide some protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. How long will immunity last if I get vaccinated? How many doses should I expect? Two of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use require two doses. Janssen’s vaccine requires one dose. Why is a vaccine necessary? If I've recovered from COVID-19, do I still need to get vaccinated? Yes. We are seeing evidence of reinfection in patients. Early evidence suggests natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this. Vaccination should not occur until the patient has met criteria to discontinue isolation. If I miss receiving the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at the recommended time, do I have to start the process over? Patients who do not receive the second vaccination dose at 21 days for Pfizer or 28 days for Moderna should still to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered A new variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 is now in the United States. Will a vaccine still be effective? Scientists are working to learn more about these variants to better understand how easily they might be transmitted and whether currently authorized vaccines will protect people against them; however, early evidence suggests the vaccines remain effective against the variant. Currently, there is no evidence that these variants cause more severe illness or increased risk of death. New information about the virologic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of these variants is rapidly emerging. The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, in collaboration with the CDC, is monitoring the situation closely. Privacy What will I need to provide to get vaccinated? This will vary for each vaccinator. Just like a regular doctor's appointment, we recommend you call ahead to ask what you will need to provide. Examples may include a driver license and insurance provider information, if applicable. This will vary for each vaccinator.

Uninsured Missourians will be able to receive the vaccination regardless of their health insurance status. If I’m uninsured, can I get vaccinated? No resident may be charged for the COVID-19 vaccine, so uninsured Missourians cannot be denied vaccination based on their health insurance status.  No resident may be charged for the COVID-19 vaccine, so uninsured Missourians cannot be denied vaccination based on their health insurance status. Availability Who will qualify first for a vaccine? Missourians will qualify for vaccination based on priority phases, anticipating a limited initial supply. Groups currently eligible include those in Phase 1A and Phase 1B and Phase 2. Priority I am a healthcare worker in 1A.  How do I get vaccinated? All healthcare workers in 1A should coordinate through their employer or member association to receive a vaccination.  Healthcare workers should communicate directly with their employer or member association regarding their desire to be vaccinated and ask their employer to keep them updated on their vaccination planning process. Local pharmacies such as Hy-Vee, CVS, Walgreens and Walmart. Employees’ primary care physicians. All healthcare workers in 1A should coordinate through their employer or member association to receive a vaccination.  Healthcare workers should communicate directly with their employer or member association regarding their desire to be vaccinated and ask their employer to keep them updated on their vaccination planning process.  I am a vaccinator. How should I work with employer of unaffiliated healthcare workers in 1A? Employers of unaffiliated healthcare workers in 1A will be instructed to identify themselves as such, inform you of their provider type and communicate the number of healthcare workers they have a need to vaccinate when contacting your location. Point of Contact; Public facing website information callers may be referred to; Waiting list coordination; Any other pertinent information. Employers of unaffiliated healthcare workers in 1A will be instructed to identify themselves as such, inform you of their provider type and communicate the number of healthcare workers they have a need to vaccinate when contacting your location. 1A providers/employers will be instructed to contact local vaccinators and arrange for a partnership to vaccinate their staff in the area.  (Statewide 1A providers will need to work with multiple vaccinators)  Once a partnership agreement has been established via communication between the provider/employer and the vaccinator, it is the expectation of the vaccinator to arrange for ordering supply to meet the cumulative demand of agreements made. What if I qualify for two priority groups? You will default into the highest Phase and Tier that you are eligible for. You will default into the highest Phase and Tier that you are eligible for. History Have we developed a coronavirus vaccine before? Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) Rumor Control There is no evidence that the mRNA vaccine causes autoimmune disorders. Rumor: COVID-19 vaccines causes autoimmune disorders. The COVID-19 vaccine will be released only when it's proven safe and effective. Rumor: The vaccine was rushed, so it can't possibly be safe. You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccines. Rumor: The vaccines can give you COVID-19. Some individuals may contract COVID-19 after being vaccinated because they may have been After receiving two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, individuals could have 94-95% clinical trial data show an estimated 85% efficacy rate against severe forms of COVID-19. likely have extremely mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. Fact: You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccines. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines (or others currently in development) contain the live virus that causes COVID-19.  This makes it impossible to get COVID-19 from the vaccine.  The vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19.                              exposed to COVID-19 prior to being vaccinated or before they obtain their second dose of vaccine. protection from contracting COVID-19 (based on clinical trial efficacy). Janssen’s If an individual still contracts COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated, the person will most There is no reason to believe that the COVID-19 vaccines will not be effective against additional strains of SARS-CoV-2. Rumor: There are new strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom and South Africa, so the new vaccines won’t be effective. Fact: : According to medical experts, including current and former U.S. Surgeon Generals, there is no firm reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed and approved in the U.S. will not be effective against new strains of the virus. Bell’s palsy is not a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine. Rumor: You can get Bell’s palsy from the COVID-19 vaccines. Cases of Bell’s palsy, a temporary condition, were reported in few participants in the mRNA consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded palsy may receive a Pfizer, Moderna or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Cases of Bell’s palsy, a temporary condition, were reported in few participants in the mRNA consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded You cannot get HIV from the COVID-19 vaccine. Rumor: I can get HIV from the COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests. Rumor: I can test positive for COVID-19 after being vaccinated. cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current vector (carrier) technology aided by a modified adenovirus. Adenoviruses cause the used as a carrier in Janssen’s vaccine has been modified to ensure no illness will result. cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current vector (carrier) technology aided by a modified adenovirus. Adenoviruses cause the If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results. The COVID-19 vaccines will not make you test positive on a diagnostic COVID-19 test (e.g., PCR or antigen test). Rumor: If I get vaccinated and am then tested for COVID-19, I will receive false positive results. The vaccine is intended to induce an immune response, so a serology test (antibody test) may be positive in someone who has been vaccinated. Fact: Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine will not affect your PCR or antigen test results since these tests check for active disease, not immunity. There is no live virus present in any of the COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine is intended to induce an immune response, so a serology test (antibody test) may be positive in someone who has been vaccinated. The flu vaccine will not protect you from coronavirus. Rumor: The flu vaccine will also work against coronavirus. However, it is important that you also consider getting the flu vaccine this year. In a typical year, more than 100,000 Missourians become sick from the flu and some are hospitalized. To ensure Missouri has the capacity to care for COVID-19 patients, we need to do whatever we can to prevent additional strains on our healthcare system. Fact: Influenza and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) belong to two different RNA virus families, so one vaccine is not interchangeable for another. Influenza belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, while SARS-CoV-2 is classified in the Coronaviridae family. Further, both the Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 rely on different protein layers to initiate responses. Influenza uses two surface antigens, while SARS-CoV-2 uses spike proteins, so their immunization approaches are different. However, it is important that you also consider getting the flu vaccine this year. In a typical year, more than 100,000 Missourians become sick from the flu and some are hospitalized. To ensure Missouri has the capacity to care for COVID-19 patients, we need to do whatever we can to prevent additional strains on our healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA. Rumor: The COVID-19 vaccines will tamper with your DNA. This rumor is false even for the Janssen vaccine, which uses viral vector (carrier) technology aided by an modified adenovirus. Fact: : That rumor is baseless. mRNA provides a set of instructions to your cells to create an immune response specific to COVID-19. Medical doctors independent of the vaccine development teams have verified that using mRNA will not alter the DNA of our body's cells. The COVID-19 vaccines were created through mRNA technology. They do not introduce DNA into your body. The COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t cause female sterilization. Rumor: The vaccine contains Syncytin-1, which is vital for the formulation of human placenta in women. Fact: Medical professionals have called this “an utterly bizarre claim.” None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain Syncytin-1. Furthermore, there are no protein-based vaccines among the candidates in phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19. Scientifically, there is no sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and Syncytin-1, so any immune response initiated by the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would not affect Syncytin-1. The COVID-19 vaccine process does not involve political figures. Rumor: The vaccine was rushed for political reasons. The approval process does not include approval from any elected official. Scientific data and information generated by large-scale clinical trials is reviewed by the U.S. FDA, medical and public health experts from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the CDC before a vaccine will be made available.The federal effort called Operation Warp Speed has no formal oversight of or control over the vaccine approval process that determines safety and efficacy. Bill and Melinda Gates are not collecting your biometric data. Rumor: Bill & Melinda Gates will use the COVID-19 vaccine to collect human biometric data that will then be uploaded to a cloud environment and connected with cryptocurrency.  Mercury has not been confirmed as an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that ethylmercury used in previous vaccines have caused harm to the human body. Rumor: Mercury will be present in the COVID-19 vaccines and is dangerous.Fact: Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines do not contain mercury. Also, mercury is not a confirmed ingredient in any other COVID-19 vaccines at this time, but has been safely used in extremely small amounts to prevent dangerous germs, like bacteria and fungi, from growing in multi-dose vaccine vials. By preventing that harmful bacteria growth, residents see fewer severe local reactions. Fact: Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines do not contain mercury. Also, mercury is not a confirmed ingredient in any other COVID-19 vaccines at this time, but has been safely used in extremely small amounts to prevent dangerous germs, like bacteria and fungi, from growing in multi-dose vaccine vials. By preventing that harmful bacteria growth, residents see fewer severe local reactions. Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the world. There are two primary types of mercury that humans may come into contact with: methylmercury and ethylmercury. Methylmercury can be toxic to humans in high doses and is not used in vaccines. Ethylmercury is used in extremely small amounts to prevent harmful bacteria from growing in vaccines and is quickly cleared from the human body. The ethlymercury medical product Thimerosal has a record of being very safe. Data from many studies show no evidence of harm caused by the extremely small amounts used in vaccines. Residents will not be used as ""guinea pigs"" if they choose vaccination. COVID-19 and the vaccine are not a hoax. Rumor:The virus is a hoax. The COVID-19 vaccine will not have a tracking chip inside of it. Rumor: Microchip hardware will be used in a vaccine to track Americans. You can still donate blood after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Rumor: Getting a COVID-19 vaccines will stop you from donating blood."

When you receive your first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you will be given a vaccination card showing the type of vaccine you received and the date of your second scheduled dose. You may also receive an electronic notification from the facility’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) when the second dose is available. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is one dose. Text/HTML COVID-19 Vaccination Plan Live Accordion How has Montana prepared to distribute the vaccine? All states were required to create a COVID-19 vaccination plan. The plan outlines three vaccination distribution phases, key critical populations to be offered the vaccine first, and how the agency is working with key partners across the state to implement Montana’s plan. This plan is subject to change based on the ACIP and CDC’s guidance about priority populations.   DPHHS announced a COVID-19 Vaccination Plan Coordination Team on November 23. The team is comprised of stakeholders from various sectors across the state, many of who are already established COVID-19 crisis response partners. The team’s first meeting was held on November 24, 2020.  DPHHS hosted a virtual Tribal Consultation on October 8, and included tribal governments, urban Indian health centers, and Indian Health Service. Text/HTML Vaccine Distribution Partners and Allocation Numbers Live Accordion How will the COVID-19 vaccine be distributed in Montana, and who will distribute it? Vaccines will be allocated to Montana several ways: through a state allocation managed by DPHHS, through an allocation specifically to long term care facilities, and to federal entities such as Indian Health Services and the Veteran’s Health Administration. Montana tribes were given the opportunity to elect whether to receive their vaccine allocation from state or federal sources.   Here’s a breakdown of how vaccine will be allocated in Montana. DPHHS will work with federal partners to distribute state vaccine allocations directly to enrolled providers across the state. The federal government is contracting with CVS, Walgreens and Big Sky Managed Care Pharmacy to offer on-site COVID-19 vaccination services for nursing homes and assisted living facilities residents. All Tribal entities were given the opportunity to either receive their allocation through federal or state channels. This includes tribal governments, Urban Indian Health Centers and Indian Health Service sites. In Montana, 5 of 8 tribal governments, all five Urban Indian Health Centers and all the IHS sites chose to get their allocation from the IHS. IHS has been recognized as their own jurisdiction. Here is the IHS vaccination plan [ihs.gov] The IHS allocation will be outside of the state allocation that DPHHS will receive.  Text/HTML Vaccine Distribution to Critical Population by Phases Live Accordion Who will receive the vaccine first? Since the vaccine is available on a limited basis, the vaccine is being distributed in phases. The COVID-19 vaccine distribution recommendations were updated on March 2, 2021. Phase 1C includes frontline essential workers not already included in Phase 1B or Phase 1B+, and individuals living in congregate care and correctional facilities not already included in Phase 1B or 1B+.   When will the vaccine be available broadly for all Montanans? On April 1, all Montanans age 16 and older will be eligible to receive the vaccine.  Text/HTML Vaccine Safety Live Accordion Are the vaccines safe? The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Safety is a top priority. The clinical trials for COVID-19 have been conducted according to the rigorous standards set forth by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If FDA determines the vaccine meets its safety standards, it can make it available for use in the U.S. by approval or Emergency Use Authorization (EAU). The FDA has made both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines available through EAU. More information about vaccine safety.  How will DPHHS monitor for safety? The current vaccine safety system has the capacity to effectively monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines both under an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and post-licensure. CDC, along with FDA and other federal partners, will use established safety systems to conduct heightened safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines.  DPHHS has a system in place to receive reports of any vaccine safety issues for all vaccines. The same system will be used to monitor for any COVID-19 vaccine safety. The DPHHS Immunization Program will be closely monitoring and responding to any safety issues identified.  Text/HTML Vaccine Administration and Storage Live Accordion Where will the vaccine be available in Montana?   Are the vaccines administered in two doses? Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine must be administered in two doses. The Pfizer vaccine must be spaced 21 days apart, and Moderna 28 days apart. Obtaining two doses is essential for the effectiveness of the vaccine and vaccine recipients will need to receive the same vaccine type as their first dose. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is a single-dose vaccine.

When will all Nevadans be able to get vaccinated? On April 5, 2021, per Governor Sisolak, all Nevadans will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. To see which groups your county is currently vaccinating and where to find a vaccination site, visit our county-specific plan page.    What are the underlying health conditions eligible to get prioritized vaccination? Click here for a complete list of underlying conditions and their risk factors. Nevada is using CDC guidance to identify the specific underlying health conditions causing a person to be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and death.These conditions are: Cancer Chronic Kidney Disease COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), Cystic Fibrosis, Pulmonary Fibrosis, And Other Chronic Lung Diseases Down Syndrome Heart Conditions, such as Heart Failure, Coronary Heart Disease, or Cardiomyopathies Immunocompromised from Solid Organ Transplant Obesity (Body Mass Index, BMI, Of 30-39) And Severe Obesity (BMI of 40 or Greater) Pregnancy Sickle Cell Disease Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Smoking Added on March 1, 2021: Asthma (moderate-to-severe) Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain) Cystic fibrosis Hypertension or high blood pressure Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines Neurologic conditions, such as dementia Liver disease Overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2, but < 30 kg/m2) Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues) Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder) Type 1 diabetes mellitus If you have an underlying condition and you have a primary care provider, please work directly with your doctor to schedule your vaccine. Are part-time residents (such as those here for the winter season) eligible to get vaccinated in Nevada? Based on updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at this time proof of residency is not required to receive a COVID-19 vaccine if the individual meets the requirement for the age group that is currently being vaccinated. The CDC states, “to achieve the public health objectives of ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of all Americans, Nevada must distribute or administer vaccine without discriminating on non-public-health grounds within a prioritized group.” In short, this means two things: Out-of-state residents within the age group currently being served in Nevada (e.g., 70 years and older, 65-69 years, etc.) cannot be denied vaccination based only on state or county residency status. Vaccinations based on occupational groups are for Nevada residents only as they are identified and determined in the Nevada-specific COVID-19 Vaccine Playbook. Ideally, individuals should be vaccinated in the county where they work. However, we encourage counties not to turn otherwise eligible individuals away if they make an appointment and successfully arrive at a vaccination event. Why do we need a vaccine if physical distancing and wearing masks can help prevent coronavirus spread? Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and physical distancing, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19. How many doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be needed? The Janssen vaccine requires just one dose to be fully effective.  How will I know when to return for my 2nd dose? The VaxText text messaging resource is a free service. By texting ENROLL to 1-833-VaxText (829-8398), vaccine recipients can opt-in to receive a weekly text reminder for their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine or a reminder for when they are overdue for their second dose, in English or Spanish. The provider who gives you your first vaccine will also give you paperwork with the follow-up date on it, and will notify you by phone, email, or text depending on their appointment system. What is v-safe After Vaccination Health Checker? When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, your healthcare provider will give you a v-safe information sheet. This sheet provides instructions on how to register and use v-safe. V-safe is a smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Through v-safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Depending on your answers, someone from CDC may call to check on you and get more information. And v-safe will remind you to get your second COVID-19 vaccine dose if you need one.  V-safe is available in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and simplified Chinese. Find more information on the CDC website.  Once I've received my vaccination, will I still need to wear a mask? Yes, for several reasons: It will take a while for everyone to get vaccinated. Scientists don't yet know if a vaccinated person can still spread the disease, even if they can't get sick. This is being studied right now.  It will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least six feet away from others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations for how to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. How much will the vaccine cost me? With limited initial supplies, it will take some time for everyone to get access, but eventually, everyone will be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine for free. The U.S. government invested in vaccine development and is purchasing and distributing the vaccine at no cost to both the insured and uninsured. However, vaccine providers (i.e. doctor's office, clinic) can get reimbursed for an office visit from health insurance or through the Provider Relief Fund when the patient is not insured. Can I still get sick from COVID-19 after I get vaccinated? It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID-19) after vaccination. That means it’s possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. Additionally, there is a chance you can still get infected from COVID-19 after becoming vaccinated but there is an extremely low chance, especially when compared to not being vaccinated. We know this from the clinical trials of the vaccines that looked at differences in the numbers of individuals who became infected with COVID-19 or seriously ill among those vaccinated compared to those that received the placebo (did not receive the vaccine). For example, in the Moderna vaccine trial, among the 15,210 who received the placebo vaccine, 185 (1.2%) developed COVID and 30 individuals became very ill. Among the 15,210 who received the vaccine, only 11 (0.07%) developed COVID and no individuals became very ill.  We use these values to calculate the 94.1% efficacy of the Moderna vaccine and the 95% efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech. For example, in the Moderna vaccine the 94% efficacy is calculated by dividing 0.07% by 1.2%, which equals 6%, and then subtracting that from 100%. A similar process was used to calculate the 95% efficacy for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.  The bottom line is that these vaccines are very effective at preventing both COVID-19 infections, especially severe cases needing hospitalization.  Sources: Pfizer/BioNTech EUAModerna EUABaden LR, El Sahly HM, Essink B, et al. Efficacy and Safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. N Engl J Med. 2021;384(5):403-416. doi:10.1056/nejmoa2035389. What do I need to know about my vaccine appointment? Please remember to bring the following required documents to your appointment:  Appointment confirmation email Photo ID   Other important reminders: Vaccination may require two (2) doses. If you receive a two-dose vaccine, the second vaccination date will be 21 or 28 days later. The provider who gave you your first dose will give you information regarding your second dose.  Any individuals who are currently sick or under isolation or quarantine for COVID-19 are not eligible to receive the vaccine until they are symptom-free and/or released based on CDC guidelines.    It is best practice to wait for 15 minutes after your vaccination before leaving the vaccination site.  Please wear clothing that allows quick and easy access to the upper arm. Expect to wait. Due to high patient volume, wait times may vary.  Can I get other vaccines, like the flu shot, at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine? No, you will need to wait two weeks after getting the COVID-19 vaccine before getting other immunizations. Conversely, if you have had another vaccine (like shingles, flu or pneumonia), you should wait two weeks before getting your COVID-19 vaccine.   How do we know the vaccines will be safe? The COVID-19 vaccine approval process is the same as it is for every U.S. vaccine. It’s a very methodical process with numerous independent groups assessing clinical trial data and making recommendations. Among the 80,000+ people who received a COVID-19 vaccine during clinical trials for now-authorized vaccines, no serious safety concerns were proven. It’s rare for a vaccine to have any side effects more than two weeks after getting it. To reflect our population, clinical trial participants include more than a third from racial and ethnic minorities, people over 65, and those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiac disease. After clinical trials, the FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency. A typical FDA team is comprised of: physicians, chemists, statisticians, pharmacologists/toxicologists, microbiologists, experts in postmarketing safety, clinical study site inspectors, manufacturing and facility inspectors, and labeling and communications experts. Two of the biggest safeguards to vaccines are the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), both of which are made up of independent experts who are not employees of the FDA or the CDC and both of which hold open meetings available to the public.  Vaccines were (and are) manufactured during clinical trials with the intention of throwing them away if they are not deemed safe and effective. Ineffective vaccines have been discarded during this process. Watch Cindy M. P. Duke, M.D., Ph.D., FACOG discuss vaccine safety  How are we continuing to monitor safety of the vaccines and what is the most recent update? Beyond the initial vaccine clinical trials, scientists are continuing to monitor the safety of the vaccines as they are being administered to the public. These monitoring systems include V-Safe, established specifically for the COVID-19 vaccines, and VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), an existing national monitoring system for reporting adverse events to vaccines. Together, these systems enable scientists to track the safety and side effects of vaccines as they are being distributed. The CDC has analyzed the information gathered from these systems and published a report reassuring the safety profiles of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc vaccines. No new concerning issues were identified among the 13.8 million vaccine doses administered between December 14, 2020 to January 13, 2021 in the United States.  Among the data, reports of local (at the site of injection) and systematic (involving the whole body) reactions were common. Reports of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction requiring medical attention) were rare and the occurrence was within the normal range of other vaccines. The occurrence of anaphylaxis from the COVID-19 vaccines was 4.5 cases per million doses. This is similar to other vaccines including inactivated influenza vaccine (1.4 per million), pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (2.5 per million), and live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (9.6 per million). Importantly, effective treatments for anaphylaxis exist and medical personnel at vaccination distributing sites are prepared. Lastly, the data showed that no deaths have been attributed to the vaccines.  Source: Gee J, Marquez P, Su J, et al. First Month of COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring — United States, December 14, 2020–January 13, 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021;70:283–288. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7008e3. How was the vaccine made & delivered so quickly when it usually takes years? Because COVID-19 is so widespread, contagious and deadly, tremendous resources have been committed to vaccine development. These are the components that have led to the COVID-19 vaccine development: Coordinated effort in the U.S. between the CDC, the National Institute of Health, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Department of Defense to accelerate development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine Intensive vaccine research and development by multiple pharmaceutical companies simultaneously Use of mRNA vaccine technology, a new approach that offers scientists an easier and faster way to produce vaccines compared to traditional vaccines, enabling them to do in months what previously took years to accomplish Widespread and diverse participation in vaccine clinical trials Aggressive funding from government ($10B) and private sources toward vaccine development Availability of Emergency Use Authorization, put in place post-9/11 to allow treatments or vaccines to be available earlier than would normally be done under the approval process In order to speed up the distribution process, vaccines are being manufactured while in clinical trials with the intention of discarding them if the vaccine is not deemed safe and effective by FDA and other authorities. Why are pharmaceutical companies exempt from being sued over COVID-19? The United States has a law called the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness, or PREP Act, which is intended to exclude lawsuits seeking financial award from products that help control a public health crisis. The pandemic is such a health crisis, and government leaders believe it is in our national interest to assume any future risk from a vaccine in order to advance development.   What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine? Side effects tell you the vaccine is working. The fever you feel is your body's mechanism to attack the virus and not the virus attacking you. According to the CDC, you should expect side effects on the arm you received the shot and some side effects throughout the rest of your body. On the arm where you received the shot, you may experience some pain, redness,  and swelling. To reduce pain and discomfort on the arm, it is recommended to apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area and to move/exercise the arm. Throughout the rest of your body, you may experience tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. To reduce discomfort from a fever, it is recommended to drink plenty of fluids and dress lightly. Not everyone experiences side effects. For those who experience side effects, they may last for a few days (2-3) but can last up to 11 days in some cases.  In clinical trials (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTec trials), no serious safety concerns have been proven. Some participants reported transient side effects including: sore arm, fever, muscle pain and fatigue that resolved in 24 hours. Older adults reported fewer and milder side effects. In a small percentage of cases these side effects were severe — defined as preventing daily activities. In clinical trials (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTec trials), no serious safety concerns have been proven. Some participants reported transient side effects including: sore arm, fever, muscle pain and fatigue that resolved in 24 hours. Older adults reported fewer and milder side effects. In a small percentage of cases these side effects were severe — defined as preventing daily activities. There were no Grade 4 reactions during clinical trials, requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization.  There were no Grade 4 reactions during clinical trials, requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html Watch this video to learn more. What should I do if I experience side effects? If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html Should I be concerned about a severe allergic reaction? An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine (EpiPen) or if the person must go to the hospital. An immediate allergic reaction happens within 4 hours after getting vaccinated and could include symptoms such as hives, swelling, and wheezing (respiratory distress). Individuals who meet any of the following criteria should be concerned about a severe allergic reaction and consult a doctor/ healthcare provider before getting the vaccine.  If you are allergic to an ingredient in a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine If you had an allergic reaction to a previous shot of an mRNA vaccine (AKA if you had a reaction to the first shot and you are concerned for the second) If you are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate If you are allergic to other types of vaccines If you have allergies not related to vaccines (food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex allergies If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. What are the vaccine ingredients? • mRNA • potassium chloride • sodium chloride • mRNA • tromethamine • acetic acid • sucrose There is no egg or egg-related component of the RNA vaccine. • Ad26.COV2.S • trisodium citrate dihydrate • hydroxypropyl betadex • sodium chloride • hydrochloric acid Can I get a vaccine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding? The COVID-19 vaccine will make me sick with COVID-19 No. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. All of them teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.  After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, I will test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test No. Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection.​ If your body develops an immune response—the goal of vaccination—there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results. The COVID-19 vaccine can cause infertility No. There is no scientific evidence that the vaccine could impact fertility. Because COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are not composed of live virus, they are not thought to cause an increased risk of infertility, first or second trimester loss, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies.  Additionally, since the vaccine is not a live virus, there is no reason to delay pregnancy attempts because of vaccination administration or to defer fertility treatment until the second dose has been administered. Cindy M. P. Duke, M.D., Ph.D., FACOG, Medical Director of the Nevada Fertility Institute explains why she recommends vaccination for her patients in this video.    I don’t need the vaccine because I’ve already had COVID No. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection. If you were treated for COVID-19 symptoms with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called “natural immunity,” varies from person to person.  It is rare for someone who has had COVID-19 to get infected again. It also is uncommon for people who do get COVID-19 again to get it within 90 days of when they recovered from their first infection.  We won’t know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have more data on how well the vaccines work. Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are working to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. Is there a microchip in the vaccine so the government can track me? No, the government is not using the vaccine to track you. There may be trackers on the vaccine shipment boxes to protect them from theft, but there are no trackers in the vaccines themselves. State governments track where you got the vaccine and which kind you received using a computerized database to make sure you get all recommended doses at the right time. You will also get a card showing that you have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Those with asymptomatic COVID can't spread the disease Throughout the pandemic, scientists have been working to understand the risk of transmission by asymptomatic carriers, and have continued to find that asymptomatic spreading contributes to the ongoing case numbers. If certain communities experience low asymptomatic spread, it is most likely a result of srict public health measures.    What is an mRNA vaccine? The authorized Pfizer-BioNTec and Moderna vaccines, and several others seeking approval, are made using messenger RNA (mRNA). This new vaccine technology is unlike traditional viral vaccines that introduce a weakened viral protein to cause an immune response. mRNA vaccines deliver instructions to the cell to build a protein that resembles a viral protein in order to generate an immune response. mRNA does not alter or modify your DNA. Mark S. Riddle, MD, DrPH, FISTM Associate Dean for Clinical Research, University of Nevada, Reno-School of Medicine, Associate Chief of Staff – Research, Veterans Administration, explains how the vaccines work. What technology does the Janssen vaccine use? The Janssen vaccine uses an adenovirus vector vaccine — a more established approach to creating immunity through vaccination. Adenovirus vector vaccines employ a harmless, inactive virus to deliver a gene that carries the blueprint for the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. The virus enters cells, which then follow the genetic instructions to construct a replica of the coronavirus spike protein. The immune system uses these replicas to recognize — and respond to — the real coronavirus. Will the vaccine alter my DNA? Mark S. Riddle, MD, DrPH, FISTM Associate Dean for Clinical Research, University of Nevada, Reno-School of Medicine, Associate Chief of Staff – Research, Veterans Administration, explains in this video. How do COVID-19 vaccines protect us? Authorized vaccines protect people by lowering their chances of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19.  If enough Nevadans get vaccinated, we can keep our businesses, restaurants, casinos, and schools open and return to doing the things we miss and move toward normalcy. Widespread vaccination will end this pandemic, the way it ended smallpox, polio, and measles. COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. Mark S. Riddle, MD, DrPH, FISTM Associate Dean for Clinical Research, University of Nevada, Reno-School of Medicine, explains the mRNA vaccine technology used by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Is there fetal tissue in the COVID-19 vaccine? There are no vaccines that involve stem cells from aborted fetuses nor were there aborted fetuses used in vaccine development. COVID-19 vaccine candidates are researched using cells derived from human fetuses electively aborted decades ago.  Some vaccines are developed with cells that came from fetuses decades ago, but these are known as cell lines which can differentiate continuously. Pfizer and Moderna strictly used them for confirmation tests only. J&J used them in development, confirmation and production. https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/you-asked-we-answered-do-the-covid-19-vaccines-contain-aborted-fetal-cells Will my vaccine protect people other than me? Herd immunity, also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. It is safest if achieved through vaccination rather than infection. However, in order to reach herd immunity, a significant portion of the population needs to be vaccinated. Like a line of matches → if one catches on fire, they all do → but if some are unable to, other matches wouldn’t be lit Millions of Americans might die of COVID if we all don't get vaccinated. The fatality rate for COVID is 2% to 3%. if you apply it to the entire U.S. population, it would equate to about 6 million to 10 million people who would die from COVID.  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2 How do I protect myself from COVID-19 while I wait for a vaccine? You should cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay six feet away from others, avoid crowds, and wash your hands often.  Will a flu vaccine protect me against COVID-19? Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19, however flu vaccination has many other important benefits. Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization and death. Getting a flu vaccine this fall will be more important than ever, not only to reduce your risk from flu but also to help conserve potentially scarce health care and public health resources. How do you get immune to COVID-19? There are two ways to develop immunity and protection from COVID -19: Get infected with the virus and develop an immune response and antibodies Get a COVID-19 vaccine which triggers your body to create an immune response and antibodies Getting the disease is risky because you don't know how serious your symptoms will be, if you will require hospitalization, or if you might die.  Getting the vaccine has no discernible risk for most people and minor, transient side effects.   Mark S. Riddle, MD, DrPH, FISTM Associate Dean for Clinical Research, University of Nevada, Reno-School of Medicine, explains immunity in this video. What are variants and are the vaccines effective against the new variants? Variants are changes in the genetic code of the virus that occur through mutations. These changes are expected and normal for viruses. While some new variants emerge and disappear, others persist. At this time, there have been multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 identified globally.  These included the United Kingdom variant (B.1.1.7), the South African variant (B.1.351), and the Brazil variant (P.1).  According to the CDC these variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants; however further research is being conducted to better understand the variants and identify ways to control their spread.  At this time, studies suggest that the current vaccines are effective against the variants but additional research is needed to further evaluation.  The CDC recommendations to help limit the spread of the variants include continuing to follow public health guidelines which include vaccination, physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, and isolation and quarantine.  You can learn more about the variants from the CDC here. What are the CDC guidelines for activities for fully vaccinated individuals? The CDC has published guidelines on safe activities for fully vaccinated people. Fully vaccinated means having received two doses of the Prizer-Biontech or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson Jansen’s vaccine.  An individual is considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after receiving their second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or 2 weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson [J&J]/Janssen). The CDC is recommending that fully vaccinated people try to only socialize with other fully vaccinated people at their home. Outside of one’s home, it is still recommended that a mask is worn and social distancing guidelines are followed. These measures serve as a stepping stone towards normalcy while ensuring safety to members in the community that have not yet received the vaccine.  The key points from the CDC recommendations are listed below. They apply to non-healthcare settings. Visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing Visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing Refrain from quarantine and testing following a known exposure if asymptomatic For now, fully vaccinated people should continue to: Take precautions in public like wearing a well-fitted mask and physical distancing Wear masks, practice physical distancing, and adhere to other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease or who have an unvaccinated household member who is at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease Wear masks, maintain physical distance, and practice other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households Avoid medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings Get tested if experiencing COVID-19 symptoms Follow guidance issued by individual employers Follow CDC and health department travel requirements and recommendations Source:“Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People”. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 8 Mar. 2021. Which vaccines are authorized by the FDA? Three vaccines are currently authorized for use in the U.S. under EUA (Emergency Use Authorization): Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine – authorized under EUA 12/11/2020 Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine – authorized under EUA 12/18/2020 Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine – authorized under EUA 2/27/2021 All three authorized vaccines provided complete protection against hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in their clinical trials and are considered extremely effective tools for ending the pandemic.  None of the three authorized vaccines contains additives that can sometimes cause strong reactions, such as antibiotics, preservatives or adjuvants (compounds used to boost the immune response to a vaccine). How effective is the Janssen vaccine? The Janssen vaccine was 100% effective at preventing death from COVID-19 in vaccine trials; 85% effective at preventing severe disease across all regions studied beginning 28 days after vaccination, including for the South African disease variant Protection against moderate to severe disease starts about two weeks after vaccination. By four weeks after the shot, data from the clinical trial showed there were no hospitalizations or deaths. Trial participants The Janssen vaccine was tested in 44,000 people in the U.S., South Africa and Latin America. Among global participants in the testing, 59% are White/Caucasian; 45% are Hispanic and/or Latinx; 19% are Black/African American; 9% are Indigenous and 3% are Asian. In the United States, 74% are White/Caucasian; 15% are Hispanic and/or Latinx; 13% are Black/African American; 6% are Asian and 1% are Indigenous. 41% of participants in the study had other conditions associated with an increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19: obesity (28.5%), type 2 diabetes (7.3%), hypertension (10.3%), HIV (2.8%); other immunocompromised participants were also included in the study. Note: Head-to-head comparisons among the three vaccines now available cannot be made, because the trials were conducted at different times during the pandemic and in different countries dealing with different variants and transmission rates. The nation’s leading medical experts urge people to take whichever COVID-19 vaccine is available to them. How effective is the Pfizer vaccine? The Pfizer vaccine was 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in vaccine trials 95% effective at preventing severe infection The nation’s leading medical experts urge people to take whichever COVID-19 vaccine is available to them. Note: Head-to-head comparisons among the three vaccines now available cannot be made, because the trials were conducted at different times during the pandemic and in different countries dealing with different variants and transmission rates. This vaccine was tested before the emergence of new virus variants in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil.    How effective is the Moderna vaccine? The Moderna vaccine was 100% effective at preventing death and severe infection from COVID-19 in vaccine trials The nation’s leading medical experts urge people to take whichever COVID-19 vaccine is available to them. Note: Head-to-head comparisons among the three vaccines now available cannot be made, because the trials were conducted at different times during the pandemic and in different countries dealing with different variants and transmission rates.   If I’m offered the new Janssen vaccine, should I take it or wait for other vaccine availability? All of the vaccines that have been authorized for use in the United States have been proven to be safe and effective. On February 27, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the total number of available COVID-19 vaccines to three. Getting vaccinated with any of the available vaccines will greatly reduce your risk of serious illness due to the virus. The nation’s leading medical experts urge people to take whichever COVID-19 vaccine is available to them. The Janssen vaccine has been shown to be 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in vaccine trials in the U.S. and other countries. In clinical trials in the U.S., it was shown to be 72% protective against moderate COVID-19 disease, an infection that isn’t serious enough to put you in the hospital, but could make you feel lousy for weeks.

"NJ","Spanish Spanish Search for COVID-19 and Reopening Information Here Which COVID-19 vaccine should I get? Are COVID-19 vaccines safe and effective? How were they tested and approved? All currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and will help protect you from getting COVID-19. In clinical trials for all three authorized vaccines, there were zero cases of hospitalizations and zero deaths among fully vaccinated individuals. The CDC does not state a preference. All the vaccines that are currently available were studied in different trials, among different people and different timelines. They were not studied in head-to-head comparisons or trials; therefore, they should not be compared to each other. You are encouraged to take the first vaccine available to you, but if you decide to wait for a specific type of vaccine the State will respect your choice. What to Know About Available COVID-19 Vaccines COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and will help protect you from getting COVID-19. Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intense safety monitoring in U.S. history. COVID-19 vaccines will not give you COVID-19. The vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development use the live virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests. Vaccines won't cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. Receiving an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer and Moderna) will not alter your DNA. mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) can most easily be described as instructions for how to make a protein or even just a piece of a protein. mRNA is not able to alter or modify a person's genetic makeup (DNA). Even after getting vaccinated, you still need to wear a mask and follow all safeguarding methods until enough individuals are vaccinated to produce community protection. The vaccine keeps you from getting sick, but we do not yet know if the vaccine prevents a person from spreading the virus. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other or with other COVID-19 vaccine products. The safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series has not been evaluated. Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product. It takes time to produce the vaccine, and the production capacity of each vaccine is increasing. People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated. At this time, experts do not know how long until someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection (natural immunity) varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggest natural immunity may not last very long. Further information from the CDC on mRNA vaccination of persons with current or prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, exposure, or treatment can be found here and should be discussed with your healthcare provider. can be found here Getting vaccinated can help prevent getting sick with COVID-19. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. If you get sick, you also may spread the disease to friends, family, and others around you while you are sick. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an immune response without having to experience sickness. Vaccine Trials and Testing COVID-19 vaccines that are authorized for use have gone through clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants to determine their safety and efficacy. The known and potential benefits of approved vaccines outweigh the known and potential harms of becoming infected with COVID-19. Currently, the Pfizer Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are being administered in New Jersey. Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has been granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and recommended by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. More information from the FDA about these three vaccines can be found here: For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, please consult these FDA fact sheets: Fact Sheet for Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Additional Information and Translated Materials Additional Information and Translated Materials For the Moderna vaccine, please consult these FDA fact sheets: Fact Sheet for Moderna Vaccine Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Moderna Vaccine Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Additional Information and Translated Materials Additional Information and Translated Materials For the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, please consult these FDA fact sheets: Fact Sheet for Jannsen Vaccine Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Jannsen Vaccine Recipients and Caregivers Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Additional Information Additional Information Clinical Trials The FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and for the Moderna vaccine, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine. Additional vaccines are in Phase 3 clinical trials For more details on the vaccine approval process, refer to this infographic and this fact sheet. Clinical trials are research studies performed in people that are aimed at evaluating a medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug, vaccine, or medical device is safe and effective in people. Currently, clinical trials are evaluating COVID-19 vaccines in many thousands of study participants to generate scientific data and other information for the FDA to determine their safety and efficacy. These clinical trials are being conducted according to rigorous safety standards. For detailed information, visit this CDC page. Like many vaccines, a COVID-19 vaccine may cause some temporary discomfort. In addition to a sore arm, side effects of the vaccines may include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell, and swollen lymph nodes. There is a small chance that vaccines could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour, which is why all individuals should be observed for at least 15 minutes after vaccination and 30 minutes if they have a history of a severe allergic reaction due to any cause.

Should I get the vaccine? Will the vaccine be safe? How does vaccine distribution work? Additional Resources Don’t see your question? Click here for additional COVID-19 vaccine FAQ’s. Common COVID-19 Vaccine Questions Getting ‘back to normal’ is going to take all of our tools. How should I protect myself both before and after I get my vaccine? How should I protect myself before and after I get my vaccine? Cover your mouth and nose with a mask or face covering when around others.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Stay 6 feet away from others and avoid crowds.  Wash your hands often.  Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. You will still need to take precautions and wear a mask after you receive the vaccine. What will it cost to get a COVID-19 vaccine?  What if I don’t have health insurance? All COVID-19 vaccines are free.  There is no cost to receive the vaccine.  You will not be billed directly.  The vaccine provider may bill your health insurance directly, but there is no co-pay.  You don’t have to have health insurance coverage to get your vaccine for free from any location. COVID-19 vaccine is available without cost, regardless of your immigration status. When I am eligible, will I be able to choose the type of vaccine that I want? New Mexico is distributing vaccine as swiftly, efficiently, and equitably as possible.  When New Mexicans receive their appointment notifications through www.vaccineNM.org, they will be notified about which vaccine they are scheduled to receive. ALL vaccines available in the U.S. prevent 100% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in clinical trials.  Please get whichever vaccine is offered, as soon as you are eligible. It could save your life. Should I get the vaccine? Will I need the COVID-19 vaccine even if I’m not in a high-risk group? Yes.  While many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe case or they may even die.  There is no way to know in advance how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at increased risk of severe complications.  Also, if you get infected, you may spread the disease to friends, family and others around you.  COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness. The sooner most people are vaccinated and protected against COVID-19 disease, the sooner New Mexicans and all Americans can get back to normal life. Does the Governor or the New Mexico Department of Health intend or have plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory? No. State and federal governments do not require people to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Some private entities may require their employees to get vaccinated. Should I get the vaccine if I’ve already had COVID-19? People who have already had the COVID-19 virus, with or without obvious symptoms, should be vaccinated. If a person currently has COVID-19, that person should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered from illness. Once the person does not have symptoms and is no longer required to isolate, they should get the vaccination.  Testing to determine prior infection is not recommended. How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe? How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe? Clinical trials involving many thousands of participants are used to investigate possible COVID-19 vaccines.  These studies generate scientific data and other information that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses to determine vaccine safety and effectiveness. After the FDA makes its determination, an independent group of scientific experts – the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) – reviews available data before making vaccine recommendations to the CDC. Both of these processes have been completed for three different vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, Inc. Vaccine Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine That means that the scientific data from the research on each of these vaccines has been reviewed by two independent teams of experts. Even after this approval, vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events (possible side effects).  If an unexpected adverse event is observed, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it was caused by the vaccine and whether it is a true safety concern. You can read more about the many strategies for ensuring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States at the CDC’s website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html For every vaccine approved for use by the FDA and ACIP, the site provides information on safety, effectiveness, recommended populations to receive the vaccine, and side effects, if any. How do I know which sources of COVID-19 vaccine information are accurate? The CDC offers this guide to check sources, including websites, that contain information about COVID-19 vaccines.https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/evalwebs.htm Is it safe to go to a facility to get a COVID-19 or any other vaccine? Yes. Providers who will be giving vaccines are practicing measures to diminish the spread of COVID-19 in their facilities. Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive? No. None of the authorized and recommended vaccines will cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have current infection. If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a chance you may test positive on some antibody tests and should be confirmed by a viral test. These antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. How do I know which sources of COVID-19 vaccine information are accurate? The CDC offers this guide to check sources, including websites, that contain information about COVID-19 vaccines.https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/evalwebs.htm Will the COVID-19 vaccine give me COVID-19? No. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. The goal for each vaccine is to teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms such as fever. These symptoms are normal, usually lasts no more than a couple of days and are a sign that the body is building immunity. How does vaccine distribution work? How many shots of COVID-19 vaccine will be needed? Three vaccines have been granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).  The first is the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.  It requires TWO shots: a first shot, followed by a second booster shot 21 days later. The second vaccine is from Moderna, Inc.  It requires TWO shots: an initial shot, followed by a second booster shot 28 days later. The most recent is the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.  It requires only a single shot. Regardless of which vaccine you receive, the second dose needs to be from the same manufacturer. Do I have to get the second shot?  How will I remember? The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require a second shot to give maximum immunity. The www.vaccinenm.org system used to register will assign an appointment for a second visit.  You will also get reminders in the same way you got your first appointment, based on how you signed up.  This will most likely be via a text message and/or email. Please also hold on to the card you received when you got your first shot.  Bring it to your second appointment to record that you finished both doses in the series. Can I get my second dose earlier or later than the recommended date?  Should I worry if there is a delay in getting my second shot? The statewide registration system will schedule your second dose as close to the recommended interval as possible. There is a “grace period” based on current research.  That allows you to get the second shot up to four days earlier than recommended.  If you accidentally get your second booster dose even sooner than that, it does not have to be repeated. Even if more than six weeks have passed since your first dose, you should still get your second dose as soon as you can. Research shows that the second booster dose for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna can be up to six weeks after the initial dose.  That means you don’t have to re-start the series even if there is a delay, such as due to weather or a cancelled appointment. Do I need to wear a mask to my vaccine appointment and after I get my vaccine? Yes. CDC recommends that during the pandemic people wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth when in contact with others outside your household, when in healthcare facilities, and when receiving any vaccine, including a COVID-19 vaccine. Wearing a mask helps protect health care workers who are giving the shot as well as other patients. Vaccines are very effective at preventing infections, but we don’t know yet how effectively they prevent transmission.  To protect your loved ones, continue to wear a mask except if you’re in a private location (like your home) just with others who have all been vaccinated too. When can I stop wearing a mask after I have been vaccinated? There is not enough information currently available to say that it’s safe to stop wearing a mask after getting the vaccine.  A mask protects you, and it also protects your family, friends and community.  You should continue to  wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands regularly  when around people outside your household. How long will the protection from the COVID-19 vaccine last? We don’t yet know how long the immunity lasts from each of the available vaccines for COVID-19.  It might require future booster shots, similar to how people need to get a new flu shot each year. How can I expect to feel after I get the vaccine? The approved COVID-19 vaccines are designed to get your body to have an immune response.  When this happens, you may feel this response happening.  Common feelings include pain and swelling on the arm that you got the shot. You may also experience fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. To reduce pain and discomfort where you got the shot, you can apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area.  You can also use or exercise your arm. You may also want to talk to your healthcare provider about taking an over-the counter medicine for pain or discomfort.  If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours or your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days, contact your healthcare provider. If you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911.

Vaccine providers can also register people by phone or when they arrive in-person for their vaccine appointment. If the vaccine provider registers the individual in-person, an email address is not required. Pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens, doing vaccinations in long-term care facilities or the federal retail pharmacy program do not use CVMS to register patients before giving vaccines. These pharmacies will use their own systems.

Currently, the list includes asthma (moderate to severe), cancer, cerebrovascular disease or history of stroke, chronic kidney disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, diabetes type 1 or 2, serious heart condition (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy), hypertension or high blood pressure, immunocompromised state (e.g., weakened immune system from immune deficiencies, HIV, taking chronic steroids or other immune weakening medicines, history of solid organ blood or bone marrow transplant), intellectual and developmental disabilities (including Down Syndrome), liver disease (including hepatitis), neurologic conditions (such as dementia and schizophrenia), pulmonary fibrosis, overweight or obesity, pregnancy, sickle cell disease (not including sickle cell trait) or thalassemia and smoking (current or former). This list of conditions may be updated by the CDC. This list of conditions may be updated by the CDC How is North Carolina promoting equity in its vaccination plan? NCDHHS has a specific focus on earning trust with historically marginalized populations. Longstanding and continuing racial and ethnic injustices in our health care system contribute to lack of trust in vaccines. The department is partnering with trusted leaders and organizations to provide accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines to all North Carolinians and ensure equitable access to vaccines. It is the responsibility of all vaccine providers to ensure equitable access to vaccines. This means taking intentional actions to reach and engage historically marginalized communities, such as partnering with providers who serve these communities to make the vaccine more accessible.  NCDHHS is embedding racial, ethnic and geographic equity into all aspects of vaccine operations and holding itself and vaccine providers accountable. Does the state require or mandate vaccination? No. North Carolina has no plan to require people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It is possible that some employers or schools will require vaccines for their employees or students. Employers may ask if you have been vaccinated but cannot require that you share any other personal medical information. What kind of identification will be required to be vaccinated? North Carolina does not require a government-issued identification card, like a driver’s license, to be vaccinated. Vaccine providers should not ask for photo identification. Instead, vaccine providers are encouraged to use other ways to confirm that they are vaccinating the right person. Vaccine providers may ask people to pre-register, to fill out a form on-site with their name, address and date of birth, or ask for a bill or other document with your name and address on it. Vaccine providers should not withhold vaccinations or appointments for vaccinations because you cannot present identification. Can non-US Citizens get the vaccine? The COVID-19 vaccine will be available to everyone for free, whether or not they have health insurance and regardless of their immigration status. Information is kept confidential and won’t be shared with ICE for immigration enforcement. Getting the vaccine does not have a negative impact on people’s chances of adjusting their immigration status. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on equal access to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine distribution sites. released a statement Can you get a vaccine in a county you don't live in? Yes. To protect the health of North Carolinians and promote equity in vaccine distribution, people who spend significant time in North Carolina and are able to spread the virus in North Carolina should be vaccinated when and where they have access to a vaccine. Vaccine providers should vaccinate North Carolinians no matter what county they live in. How much will the vaccines cost? There is no cost. They are free to everyone, even if you don’t have health insurance. The federal government is covering the cost. Administration fees will also be covered for those who are uninsured and should be covered by all health insurance companies. No vaccine provider should be charging anyone to receive the vaccine. Patients who get the vaccine while having an appointment for another reason, such as a medical check-up, may be charged for the check-up depending on their insurance. Providers administering the vaccine to people without health insurance or whose insurance does not provide coverage of the vaccine can request reimbursement for the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine through the Provider Relief Fund, see https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim. https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim Special Populations Are children able to get the vaccine? Children will not receive vaccines until clinical trials are completed to ensure the vaccines are safe and work to prevent COVID-19 illness in children. The Pfizer vaccine can be given to teenagers aged 16 and up. Many vaccines, including the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, are being studied in children in the United States. How will staff and residents in long-term care facilities be vaccinated? The federal government manages most vaccinations for staff and residents of long-term care facilities. Long-term care facilities include skilled nursing facilities, adult care homes, and continuing care retirement communities. The federal government has created the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program with CVS and Walgreens to work with long-term care facilities to give vaccinations. They are currently vaccinating staff and residents. Should pregnant women be vaccinated? Pregnant and breastfeeding women may choose to receive the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnant women can talk with their doctors before making the choice. You do not need to take a pregnancy test before you get your vaccine. Women who are breastfeeding may also choose to get vaccinated. The vaccine is not thought to be a risk to a baby who is breastfeeding. Read additional information. Read additional information Do people who have had COVID-19 still need to be vaccinated? Yes. The vaccine works to protect you against a future infection. You don’t need a COVID-19 test before vaccination. It is safe to get vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine if you have been infected in the past. If you were treated for COVID-19 symptoms with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Read additional information about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Read additional information Should I get vaccinated against COVID-19 if I am currently sick with COVID-19? No. People who are actively sick with COVID-19 should wait until they have recovered and can no longer spread the virus before getting their vaccine. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 between their first and second dose of a two-dose vaccine. For two-dose vaccines, the second dose can be given up to 6 weeks after the first dose and still be very effective, so do not worry if you have to reschedule your appointment for a later date. Once you have recovered, it is safe to get vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine if you have been infected in the past. How COVID-19 Vaccines Work Vaccine Safety Are there vaccines that are safe and work in preventing COVID-19? Yes. Three vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) have proven to provide significant protection against COVID-19 and protect against virus-related hospitalization and death, with no serious safety concerns in the clinical trials. Who makes sure the vaccines are safe and can prevent COVID-19? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) makes sure all food and drugs are safe. The COVID-19 vaccines must pass clinical trials like other drugs and vaccines. The FDA checks the work and authorizes vaccines only if they are safe and effective. Because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people to prevent serious diseases, they’re held to very high safety standards. The FDA can get vaccines to people faster through an Emergency Use Authorization. After the FDA has authorized a vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) independent advisory committee reviews the data before advising the CDC on recommending a vaccine for use among the general public. Like all vaccines, the FDA keeps checking safety through the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Health care providers are required to report serious side effects, or if someone gets seriously ill with COVID-19. There is also a smartphone-based health checker called V-SAFE that uses text messaging and web surveys to do health check-ins after people receive a COVID-19 vaccination. People can report any problems they may have with a vaccine through V-SAFE. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) V-SAFE Are there side effects from the vaccines? No serious side effects were reported in clinical trials. Temporary reactions after receiving the vaccine may include a sore arm, headache or feeling tired and achy for a day or two and in some cases, fever. These temporary reactions were more common after the second dose in a two-dose vaccine. In most cases, these temporary reactions are normal, which are good signs that your body is building protection. You can take medicines like Tylenol or ibuprofen after receiving your shot to help with these temporary reactions. While extremely rare, there have been a few cases of severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine outside of the clinical trials, and vaccine providers are prepared with medicines if they need to treat these rare allergic reactions. What do we know about the vaccine's long-term safety? Since most of the vaccine trials began in the summer of 2020, we have months, not years, of follow-up data. Fortunately, we have decades of vaccine safety data from other vaccines and we know that long-term side effects are quite rare. The CDC is actively collecting safety data via the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which has been tracking safety on all vaccines since 1990. Learn more about all the ways that vaccine safety is being monitored here. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System here What is the risk of an allergic reaction from the vaccine? People who have had severe allergic reactions, also called anaphylaxis, to any ingredient in the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines should not receive that vaccine. People who have had this type of severe allergic reaction to any vaccine or treatment that is injected should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of vaccination. People with allergies to foods, animals, environmental triggers (such as pollen), latex or medications taken by mouth or who have family members with past severe allergic reactions, can be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Severe allergic reactions to the vaccines have been very rare and mostly occurred in people who have had previous severe allergic reactions. Pfizer Moderna very rare Vaccine providers will watch patients for 15-30 minutes after vaccination to ensure the patient’s safety. Additional information can be found here for the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. here How do I report an adverse reaction caused by the COVID-19 vaccine?  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) v-safe What temporary reactions from the vaccine should be reported to a doctor? In most cases, temporary reactions are normal and good signs that your body is building protection. You can talk to your health care provider about ways to help with these temporary reactions, such as drinking lots of fluids, placing a cool washcloth on your forehead or taking over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or Tylenol. If you have a history of allergic reactions to any vaccine or treatment that is injected, you should talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of vaccination before getting the shot. Although very rare, if you experience a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of your face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over your body and dizziness and weakness.  Also contact your doctor if any redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours or if your temporary reactions are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days. Are there fetal cells or fetal tissues in the vaccine? None of the vaccines contain fetal cells or fetal tissues. Fetal cells were used in research to develop all three vaccines. Vaccines commonly use fetal cells in development. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not require the use of any fetal cells to produce the vaccines. In order to produce the vaccine, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine uses fetal cells that were isolated over 30 years ago. Does the vaccine affect fertility? No. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends vaccination for all eligible people, including those who may want to get pregnant. Women in the clinical trials successfully became pregnant following vaccination and there have been no safety data to suggest that the vaccines impact the ability of a woman to get pregnant. Similarly, the Society for Male Reproduction and Urology recommends that men who desire fertility should be encouraged to get vaccinated when they are eligible. Vaccine Protection For how long will the vaccine protect me against COVID-19? Since the clinical trials ended recently, we know that the vaccines can protect people from COVID-19 illness for at least two months. We’ll know even more about how long the immunity from the vaccines lasts as people have been vaccinated for a longer period of time. With additional data, we will know if COVID-19 vaccines will need to be given yearly, like the flu shot.  Will people who have been vaccinated still need to quarantine? People who are vaccinated do not have to quarantine after an exposure to someone with COVID-19 if they meet all of the following criteria: More information can be found from the CDC here. Scientists are still learning how long people are protected after vaccination. The CDC guidance states that people do not need to quarantine if exposed within 3 months after vaccination, but this time frame is likely to change as we learn more. here What percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated to have herd immunity? Herd immunity means that enough people in a community are protected from getting a disease because they’ve already had the disease, or they’ve been vaccinated. Herd immunity makes it hard for the disease to spread from person to person, and it even protects those who cannot be vaccinated. The percentage of people who need to have protection in order to achieve herd immunity varies by disease. CDC and other experts are studying herd immunity for COVID-19 and will provide more information as it is available. When am I considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19? You are considered fully vaccinated if it has been at least two weeks after your single dose vaccine or at least two weeks after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine. Vaccine Development and Authorization What other COVID-19 vaccines are being developed and considered? It is difficult to say when other vaccines will be available. As of February 2021, Phase 3 clinical trials (the last phase) are in progress, being planned or completed in the United States for the following COVID-19 vaccines: You cannot get COVID-19 from any of these vaccines in development. All of the above vaccines teach your body to make germ-fighting antibodies against the COVID-19 virus. These germ-fighting antibodies are then ready to fight off the real COVID-19 if it ever tries to attack you. How can someone enroll in a clinical trial for a vaccine? Over 100 vaccines for COVID-19 are under development and many are in clinical trials that are recruiting participants. People interested in enrolling in a COVID-19 vaccine trial may visit the following website: https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/clinical-study-locations/. https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/clinical-study-locations/ How COVID-19 Vaccines Work How do the vaccines work? You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccines. All of the currently authorized vaccines give your body temporary instructions to make a protein. The two-dose vaccines use mRNA technology, while the one-dose vaccine uses DNA technology to provide these instructions. This protein safely teaches your body to make germ-fighting antibodies against the COVID-19 virus. These germ-fighting antibodies are then ready to fight off the real COVID-19 if it ever tries to attack you. Your body naturally breaks down everything in the vaccine. There is no COVID-19 virus in the vaccine, and none of the vaccines can change your DNA. Will the vaccines work against new variants of the COVID-19 virus? All viruses change over time, and these changes (or variants) are expected. Scientists are working to learn more about new COVID-19 variants and their effects on vaccines, although recent studies suggest that the germ-fighting cells created by vaccination are also able to fight against many of the variants. We do know that some of the new variants spread more easily, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to keep practicing the 3Ws: washing your hands, waiting six feet apart and wearing a mask around people you don’t live with. More information can be found on the CDC website. CDC website Why are two vaccine shots necessary for some vaccinations? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots a set number of days apart. You need two doses to build up strong immunity against COVID-19. The goal of the first vaccine dose is to “prime” the immune response, which means that it gets your body ready to have the best protection. The second dose “boosts” the immune response to be fully protected. The second shot will come about 3-4 weeks after the first. It is important to get two doses of the same vaccine. While other countries may take a different approach to vaccinations, the FDA and CDC continue to recommend that everyone get two shots for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Currently there are not enough data to suggest that one shot of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines offers enough protection against COVID-19. Additional COVID-19 vaccines are in Phase 3 clinical trials. Learn more about the different COVID-19 vaccines. different COVID-19 vaccines What are the differences between the one-dose and two dose vaccines? The two-dose vaccines use mRNA to give your body temporary instructions to make a protein that teaches your body to make germ-fighting antibodies against the COVID-19 virus. Instead of mRNA, the one-dose vaccine (made by Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) uses DNA to give your body the same type of temporary instructions. The DNA is carried into the body on a harmless virus called adenovirus. Your body naturally breaks down everything in the vaccine. All of the vaccines are very effective in preventing COVID-19 illness as well as preventing hospitalization and death. All of the clinical trials showed no serious safety concerns. Your body naturally breaks down everything in the vaccine. There is no COVID-19 virus in the vaccine and none of the vaccines can change your DNA. People who receive the one-dose vaccine do not need to return for a second vaccination. The temporary reactions are similar among all vaccines, although people receiving the one-dose vaccine may only experience temporary reactions once. Temporary reactions may include a sore arm, headache, fever and feeling tired and achy for a day or two after receiving the vaccine. Younger people are more likely to have reactions than older people. None of the vaccines can give you COVID-19. Additionally, the one-dose vaccine also can be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to three months. What are the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines? All the COVID-19 vaccines give the cells in your body the instructions to make a protein that safely teaches your body how to make antibodies (germ-fighting cells) to fight the real COVID-19. Your body naturally destroys the instructions and gets rid of them. None of the vaccine ingredients remain in your system, nor do they alter any DNA in your body. The three COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States do not contain eggs, preservatives, fetal tissue, stem cells, mercury or latex. For a full list of ingredients, please see each vaccine’s Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers:  Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine Vaccine Shipping and Storage How many vaccines will the state receive? States are receiving limited supplies. The federal government decides how many COVID-19 vaccines each state gets based on the state’s population of people aged 18 and up. NCDHHS then determines which vaccine providers will receive vaccine doses each week based on their ability to reach prioritized populations. Some providers in North Carolina also receive vaccine doses directly from the federal government, such as partners in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program or the Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program. Federal Retail Pharmacy Program How will the vaccine be shipped? The federal government tells states how many vaccines they will get each week. NC DHHS then determines which vaccine providers will receive vaccine doses based on their ability to reach prioritized populations. The manufacturer then ships the vaccines and vaccination supply kits directly to the local vaccine providers in North Carolina.  How will the vaccine be stored? North Carolina is working closely with providers to safely store vaccines, particularly those that need ultra-cold storage or frozen storage. Vaccines that need ultra-cold storage will come with packaging and cooling material for places that do not have permanent ultra-cold storage. The state, the manufacturer and the CDC deliver training on COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration.  Vaccine Data How will the state know who has been vaccinated? North Carolina will use the COVID-19 Vaccine Management System (CVMS), a free, secure, web-based system accessible to all providers who give COVID-19 vaccinations. It helps vaccine providers know who has been vaccinated and with which vaccine to make sure people get the second dose of the same vaccine at the right time. It also allows the state to manage vaccine supply. Pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens doing vaccinations in long-term care facilities, will not use CVMS to give and manage vaccines. These pharmacies will use their own systems. What data is the state collecting and how will it be shared? Information about your COVID-19 vaccination is carefully managed to protect your privacy. Your immunization information will not be shared except in accordance with state and federal law. NC CVMS is a system that enables the collection of immunization information for health and safety reasons. The immunization information collected for NC CVMS is similar to the information that is required when you go to the doctor’s office or a pharmacy for a vaccination, including your name, address, date of birth, location where vaccine was given, when the vaccine was given, person who administered the vaccine, information about the specific vaccine vial (expiration date, vaccine identifier number, etc.) and how the vaccine was given (e.g., in the muscle of the right arm). NC CVMS also collects information about race and ethnicity, which is necessary to support efforts for equitable vaccine distribution in NC.  To meet federal requirements established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and in accordance with NC state law, NC does not submit any identifiable information to CDC. Instead of the CDC requested identifying information, NC is currently submitting the vaccine recipient’s year of birth (not date of birth), the first 3 digits of the vaccine recipient’s zip code of residence (if the underlying population in that zip code includes more than 20,000 people) and the date of submission of the vaccination record. More information about federal CDC data requirements is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/requirements/index.html. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/requirements/index.html What data about vaccinations will be available to the public? North Carolina has an online public dashboard to share data on vaccinations. The data in the dashboard is updated Monday through Friday. public dashboard Before and After Your Vaccination Getting Vaccinated What can I do to protect myself from COVID-19 while I am waiting to be vaccinated? North Carolinians should continue to practice the 3Ws - wear a mask, wait 6 feet apart and wash your hands - while they wait to get vaccinated and after they have been vaccinated to continue to slow the spread of COVID-19. Why do I need to get a vaccine if I can practice other things like social distancing to prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading? Vaccines work to prepare your body to fight the virus if you are exposed to it. Other steps, like the 3Ws-wear a mask, wait 6 feet apart and wash your hands -help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine and following the 3Ws is everyone’s best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. Will I be able to choose which vaccine I get? Due to the limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines, we strongly recommend people take the first vaccine that is offered to them. All three available vaccines are very effective in preventing hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19. The Pfizer vaccine is approved for people age 16 and older, while the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are approved for adults 18 and older. Will I need to sign a consent form to get vaccinated? You can provide verbal consent. Written consent is not generally required, but some providers may require or request written consent. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I just got another vaccine for something else? Wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. If you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine. If two shots are necessary for some vaccinations, how will people know when to get their second shot? North Carolina will use a secure data system called the COVID-19 Vaccine Management System (CVMS) to make sure you are safe and get your second shot at the right time. When a person gets the first shot, they get information on when to come back for the second and they are asked to make a second appointment. People will also be given a card with information about which vaccine they got for their first dose and the date of that shot. Keep the card in a safe spot and take a picture of it just in case it gets misplaced. People will receive an email notification with a reminder for the second shot. Individuals who choose to use v-safe, a CDC tool to provide personalized health check-ins after their shot, will receive text reminders for their second dose. The provider who gave the vaccine may also help with reminders for the second shot. State and federal privacy laws make sure none of your private information will be shared. The shot you take and when you need the second is confidential health information that is carefully managed to protect your privacy. If you are getting a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine, you can get the first dose anywhere. You will need to get your second shot from the same vaccine provider. The federal government automatically ships your second vaccine dose to the same provider who gave you your first dose. What happens if you don't get your second dose on the right day? You should get the second vaccine dose as close to the recommended time as possible—3 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech or 4 weeks for Moderna. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be scheduled up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. If you do not get your second dose within 6 weeks, you do not need to start again at the first dose. Currently, there are not much data on if the vaccines work well if given after this window. The vaccine can be given up to 4 days early and still work. If you get the second dose too early, you should not get another dose.   After Getting Vaccinated Will people be provided with documentation that they have had the vaccine? Yes. You should receive a vaccination card that tells you what COVID-19 vaccine you received, the date you received it, and where you received it. People with access to email will also receive an email with proof of vaccination. Will the vaccine affect testing for possible COVID-19 infection? Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the most common tests used to test for the COVID-19 virus, which are called PCR or antigen tests. The vaccines do not affect these test results because there is no virus in the vaccines.  However, vaccines can affect the results of some COVID-19 antibody tests because of the immune response to the vaccine. More details can be found from the CDC here. here What should you keep doing after you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19? Receiving the COVID-19 shot and following the 3 Ws is everyone’s best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19.

"OH"," Ohio.gov Introduction Curious about COVID-19 vaccines, their safety, and efficacy? Educate yourself by reading what is a myth, and what is a fact, about COVID-19 vaccines. Myth: COVID-19 vaccines aren’t safe. FACT: COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Safety has been a top priority throughout the vaccine development and approval process. All of the vaccines were proven to be effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 vaccine development processes involved several steps comparable with those used to develop other vaccines, such as the flu or chickenpox vaccine. Clinical trials study the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine in thousands of study participants. No serious safety concerns emerged during the clinical trials for the three authorized vaccines. There were more than 116,000 participants between the three clinical studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses rigorous standards and insights from independent medical professionals to evaluate trial data to ensure that a vaccine is safe and effective and the benefits outweigh the risks. After an FDA decision, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also reviews available data before making final recommendations for vaccine use. Safety continues to be a top priority, as vaccine administration is under way, through continuous safety monitoring measures. The CDC and other federal partners continue to monitor the new vaccines for side effects and adverse events, using many vaccine safety monitoring systems. This continued monitoring could reveal effects that may not have been observed in clinical trials. Myth: COVID-19 vaccines were rushed and developed too quickly. FACT: COVID-19 vaccine development and clinical trials were thorough, and thanks to a strategic scientific effort to streamline processes, could be developed more efficiently. There have been no shortcuts in the vaccine development process. The process has been quicker as a result of strategic efforts to run concurrent trial phases, as well as a commitment to help condense timelines and reduce or eliminate months-long waiting periods during which documents would be prepared or be waiting for review. In addition, during the process of vaccine development, the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer, and Sanofi made a historic pledge, outlining a united commitment to uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work toward potential regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines. Years of research laid the groundwork for development of COVID-19 vaccines. The approved vaccines use different methods to achieve the same end result, which is to teach our bodies how to recognize COVID-19’s spike protein and create antibodies against it. Messenger RNA (mRNA), used by two of the authorized vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), has been studied for years and was being developed for other infectious diseases. Recent technological advancements in RNA biology and chemistry, as well as delivery systems, have allowed these COVID-19 vaccines using mRNA to be developed as safe and effective vaccines. Adenovirus/viral vector vaccines, the method used by Johnson & Johnson, are common. Read more about how the different COVID-19 vaccines work at coronavirus.ohio.gov. Myth: Vaccines that use mRNA will alter my DNA or genetic makeup. FACT: COVID-19 vaccines will not alter your DNA. None of the COVID-19 vaccines will alter your DNA. There are differences in how the vaccines work to teach the body to build immunity against COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. These vaccines provide instructions for the body to create the harmless surface or “spike” protein found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19); the body responds by building antibodies to destroy the protein. This protein is what allows the virus to attach to cells. When the body kills the protein, it also kills viruses that are attached to it. The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine is a viral vector vaccine using a harmless, inactive adenovirus (cold virus) as the transportation device to do the same job. They all use the harmless “spike” protein to teach the body how to recognize the virus, and to build protection against the virus. None of them change your DNA. Myth: COVID-19 vaccines will be mandatory for every Ohioan. FACT: Ohio will not make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory. The state of Ohio will not require anyone to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine will be available to all Ohioans who choose to receive it, as available supply of the vaccine increases. Myth: You can get COVID-19 from COVID-19 vaccines. FACT: COVID-19 vaccines will not give you COVID-19. None of the COVID-19 vaccines use the virus that causes COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. These vaccines provide instructions for the body to create the harmless surface or “spike” protein found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19); the body responds by building antibodies to destroy the protein. This protein is what allows the virus to attach to cells. When the body kills the protein, it also kills viruses that are attached to it. The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine is a viral vector vaccine using a harmless, inactive adenovirus (cold virus) as the transportation device to do the same job. None of the vaccines will give you COVID-19 or the cold virus. Myth: If I have recovered from COVID-19, I don’t need to get the COVID-19 vaccine. FACT: People who have recovered from COVID-19 are advised to get vaccinated. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Because of the severe health risks associated with COVID-19, and because re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends individuals get vaccinated regardless of whether they’ve already had COVID-19. Individuals who were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma are advised to wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts are still learning more about how long vaccines protect against COVID-19. Myth: COVID-19 isn’t very serious, so I don’t need to get the vaccine. FACT: The severity of COVID-19 symptoms varies widely, and getting vaccinated can help prevent infection with COVID-19. While many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness that results in hospitalization or death. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at increased risk of severe complications. Also, if you get COVID-19, you may spread the disease to friends, family, and others around you while you are sick. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by allowing your body to create an antibody response without having to experience sickness. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work. Myth: You will get a positive COVID-19 viral test if you receive the COVID-19 vaccine. FACT: COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests. The COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results, according to the CDC. Myth: Other vaccines, like the flu shot, will prevent COVID-19. FACT: Only vaccines designed specifically to prevent COVID-19 will protect you from COVID-19. Other vaccines, such as those for flu, measles, or other diseases, will not protect you from COVID-19. Only vaccines designed specifically to protect you from COVID-19 can prevent it. While a flu vaccine will not prevent you from getting COVID-19, it can prevent you from getting influenza (flu) at the same time as COVID-19. Myth: There will not be enough vaccines for everyone. FACT: As production of vaccine continues to grow, every Ohioan who chooses to do so will be able to receive a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.  The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for three COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine supply is increasing, but is still limited; therefore, Ohio is offering the vaccine first to the populations at the highest risk for severe complications from COVID-19 disease, or heightened risk of exposure. Ohio is committed to making the vaccine widely available, for those who want to receive it, as quickly as possible as supply increases. In time, as vaccine production ramps up and large quantities are available, every Ohioan who chooses to do so will be able to get vaccinated. Myth: COVID-19 vaccines will implant tracking microchips in people. FACT: Vaccine injections do not contain tracking microchips. No vaccine injections or nasal sprays – including the shots for COVID-19 – contain microchips, nanochips, RFID trackers, or devices that would track or control your body in any way. Much like the way any shipment or delivery is tracked, shipments of vaccine doses will be monitored as they are shipped and administered across the country. However, the notion that these shots will contain tracking devices implanted into Ohioans is false. Myth: COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or other serious medical problems.  FACT: No serious safety concerns have been observed for the COVID-19 vaccines that have received emergency use authorization in the U.S. No serious safety concerns have resulted from testing or real-world use of any of the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines. The most common side effects are fatigue, headache, fever, soreness, swelling or redness at the injection site, and muscle or joint pain. Side effects like these are minor and a sign that your body is responding properly to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Myth: My children will be forced to get a vaccine. FACT: Children are not yet eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Ohio is not mandating COVID-19 vaccines, and at this time, the COVID-19 vaccines that have received emergency use authorization (EUA) are not recommended for children younger than 16. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is recommended for people ages 16 and older, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccines are recommended for people ages 18 and older. While additional clinical trial data is being gathered, children, like adults, should wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth, stay 6 feet apart from others, wash their hands frequently, and avoid congregating in groups in order to protect themselves from COVID-19.  Myth: Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not get COVID-19 vaccines. FACT: Pregnant and breastfeeding women may choose to be vaccinated.  The CDC and groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say all three vaccines should be made available to those who are pregnant, but they leave the choice about whether to get vaccinated up to each individual. Pregnant women were not included in the initial clinical trials for the three authorized vaccines, so there's no data specific to pregnant women. There are no known risks to pregnant women or developing fetuses, according to the CDC. Women who are pregnant are at higher risk of a severe case of COVID-19 if they do become infected. Women are encouraged to discuss whether or not they should receive the vaccine with their healthcare providers. Pregnant women are currently eligible to receive the vaccine in Ohio under Phase 1C. Myth: Once I get a vaccine, I can stop wearing a mask and social distancing. FACT: You should continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing after being vaccinated. The vaccines protect against serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19; however, not enough is known about whether individuals can still carry the virus and spread it to others. Those who get the vaccine should continue to wear masks and practice social distancing. Myth: Vaccines cause autism. FACT: Vaccines do not cause autism. Studies conducted across the globe continue to show that there is no connection between autism and vaccines. Myth: The side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines are worse than getting COVID-19. FACT: Side effects from the vaccines are minor and a sign that the body is building immunity. Many people will experience side effects after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, but the vast majority are very short term and minor. Some people have reported experiencing soreness or redness at the site of the injection, body aches, headaches or fever, lasting for a day or two. Severe reactions, or anaphylaxis, are rare. If you have allergies — especially severe ones that include allergies to other vaccines or ingredients in the vaccines — discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with your doctor, who can assess your risk and provide more information about if and how you can get vaccinated safely. Myth: The COVID-19 vaccines won’t protect us against new strains of the virus. FACT: The data so far suggest that most of the COVID-19 vaccines do provide protection against the new COVID-19 variants. Researchers continue to study how these variants behave differently than the original strain, as well as the protection the COVID-19 vaccines offer against all variants. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, scientists tested the vaccines against several emerging variants, including those detected in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa, and the vaccines have proven effective so far against those mutations. But the current vaccines may be less effective for certain strains of the virus, such as the strain first identified in South Africa, than other variants. The degree to which the vaccines could be less effective is not yet fully known. Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they could alter their vaccine formulas slightly, if that is deemed necessary, to create additional protection against new emerging strains and are studying possible booster doses that could target specific variants. The newly authorized Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine did include testing in areas where variants were rampant, including South Africa, and during a time in which variants were emerging in multiple countries. How do I know which sources of COVID-19 vaccine information are accurate? It can be difficult to know which sources of information you can trust. The internet, unfortunately, can be filled with dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. The best thing you can do is educate yourself about the vaccines with trustworthy information.

Vaccine scheduler portal Portal Notifications Scheduling your first appointment. Scheduling your second appointment VACCINE SAFETY mRNA vaccines are a type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein — or even just a piece of a protein — that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.  COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the “spike protein.” The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.  Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection.  The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is that those vaccinated gain this protection without having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. WHAT TO DO ONCE YOU GET THE VACCINE We recommend you receive the vaccine, even if you have already had COVID-19. The protection someone gains from having an infection (called natural immunity) varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. Since this virus is new, we don’t know how long natural immunity might last.  The CDC reports that some early evidence suggests that natural immunity may not last very long. Getting the vaccine, even if you already had COVID-19, will help you protect yourself and others. Vaccine Scheduler Portal What is the Vaccine Scheduler Portal? Where can I access the Vaccine Scheduler Portal? What if I don’t have access to the Internet or a mobile device? Who can schedule an appointment right now? What is the difference between pre-registration and scheduling an appointment? Pre-registration allows anyone in Oklahoma to register their contact information with the Oklahoma State Department of Health and indicate that they would like to be notified when the vaccine is available to them. After you enter your information, if you’re eligible to receive the vaccine, you will receive an email with instructions on how to schedule your appointment. What happens once I enter my information? Can I pre-register and schedule an appointment for multiple people in my household at the same time? Does the Vaccine Scheduler Portal support other languages, like Spanish? I didn’t get the chance to finish my registration/I accidentally abandoned the registration before I was finished filling it out. I keep getting an error message saying I’ve already registered. What do I do? Due to system security, If you begin filling out the registration form or scheduling an appointment and abandon it midway through, it’s likely you will have to wait 24 hours before you can access the forms again using your previously supplied email address.  What do I do if I need to make a change to my registration information? The portal does not allow for changes after a form is submitted. If you made a mistake on your registration or need to update information, individuals will  need to register their information again with a new email address. Portal Notifications I pre-registered, but I didn’t get a confirmation email. What emails should I expect to receive from the Vaccine Scheduler Portal? What happens if I accidentally delete the email containing the link to schedule an appointment? If you’re eligible and have not scheduled an appointment yet, a new email is generated every 4 days with a link and a reminder to schedule an appointment.  Please use the following links for additional information: https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/2021/january/osdh-launches-online-portal-for-easy-covid-19-vaccine-registrati.html https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/vaccine-information/vaccine-faqs.html https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/vaccine-information.html Scheduling Your First Appointment When can I use the Vaccine Scheduler Portal to schedule my appointment? I have registered and am part of the current vaccination phase, but there are no appointment slots available. What do I do? Why are there so few appointments available? What happens if I need to cancel or reschedule my appointment? What happens if I miss or need to cancel my appointment? Unfortunately, if you miss your appointment you will have to reschedule and book another appointment at the next available time slot.  As these time slots are high in demand, please remember to mark your calendars and set reminders in order to avoid missing appointments. What happens after my first appointment? How do I know when to get my second dose? How do I find out which locations are carrying which vaccine? How do I check for available appointments each week? How much does the vaccine cost? Scheduling Your Second Appointment How do I schedule my second dose appointment? Because there are a number of ways that you may have scheduled your first dose, and because individual local providers have different procedures for vaccine appointment follow-up, you may or may not have received specific instructions for scheduling your second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. We encourage all Oklahomans to be their own best patient advocate and to ask during their first dose appointment what the best process is for scheduling the second dose.  You do not need to schedule an appointment, they have already set it for you. Use that link to locate the vaccine center location, date and time you want to receive your second dose. Path C: If you did not use the portal to register or schedule your first dose, you can still use the portal to book ONLY a second dose. You should register at vaccinate.oklahoma.gov, paying special attention to the question asking “Will this be your first COVID-19 vaccine dose?” Be sure to answer “no” to this question to indicate you are seeking your second dose. You will then be asked, “Please select from the dropdown list below to show your vaccine type - Pfizer or Moderna.” You will need to indicate the type of vaccine you received for your first dose. This can be found on the immunization record card that was given to you at the time you received your first dose. As you re-register through the portal, you will need to use either a new email address, or additional details in your name (for example, spelling out your full, legal middle name). You cannot re-register with identical personal information. Path E: If all else fails, you can call 211 and they can assist in scheduling your appointment. You will need to provide your name and phone number and  tell the call center staff that you need a second dose appointment call back. A staff member from the health department in your county of residence will return your call within 7-10 business days to manually schedule your second dose appointment outside the scheduling portal. We recommend this solution as a last resort because it will take much longer to arrange your appointment this way, and we ask your patience as our county health department staff work to set up your appointment. You do not need to schedule an appointment, they have already set it for you. They may have given you a card or told you to come back at a certain day/time to receive your second dose. This is your appointment.  You do not need to schedule an appointment, they have already set it for you. Use that link to locate the vaccine center location, date and time you want to receive your second dose. After your first dose appointment is complete, you will receive an email with a link to book your second dose. Use that link to locate the vaccine center location, date and time you want to receive your second dose.  Look for vaccine clinics entitled “BOOSTER 2nd DOSE,” as these clinics have been specifically set up to serve people seeking their second dose. After you answer “no” you will receive a series of questions. The first question will be “Was your first vaccine appointment booked from this portal?” You should answer “no.” You should register at vaccinate.oklahoma.gov, paying special attention to the question asking “Will this be your first COVID-19 vaccine dose?” Be sure to answer “no” to this question to indicate you are seeking your second dose.  After you answer “no” you will receive a series of questions.

As you re-register through the portal, you will need to use either a new email address, or additional details in your name (for example, spelling out your full, legal middle name). You cannot re-register with identical personal information. Before you re-register, check your spam folder to ensure your email isn’t there. We have received many reports of confirmation emails going to spam folders, so there is a good chance it may have gone to spam. As you re-register through the portal, you will need to use either a new email address, or additional details in your name (for example, spelling out your full, legal middle name). You cannot re-register with identical personal information.  You are able to re-register and indicate you are seeking your second dose by following the instructions for “Path C” above.

Updated 3/26/21  Similar to COVID-19 testing in Rhode Island, there are different ways to get vaccinated in Rhode Island. The three main ways that people can get vaccinated are: State vaccination sites, designated local pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Stop & Shop), and other local and regional vaccination sites, like clinics run by cities and towns, hospitals, community health centers, and other sites in the community. Please go to covid.ri.gov/vaccination or C19VaccineRI.org to learn how to get a vaccine at a state-run site, a local pharmacy, or at a local or regional vaccine site.   Please note: To get vaccinated in Rhode Island, you must live in Rhode Island, work in Rhode Island, or go to school in Rhode Island. How do I register to get vaccinated? Updated 3/26/21  Eligible Rhode Islanders can schedule an appointment online at www.vaccinateRI.org.   If you need help scheduling an appointment or would prefer to schedule your appointment over the phone, you can call the automated phone line, 844-930-1779, or 2-1-1.  At 2-1-1, a live, trained person can offer help scheduling appointments on VaccinateRI.org or signing up for the COVID-19 Vaccine Interest Notification List on portal.ri.gov. This help is available in multiple languages, is free to all Rhode Islanders, and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   A person may schedule and consent to vaccination, online or on the phone, for someone else with verbal approval. Appointments will be limited and you must have an appointment to get vaccinated. You cannot just walk in get vaccinated.  This video by the Rhode Island National Guard goes over how to register for a vaccination appointment: https://fb.watch/3-L0Kz56XS/   What information do I need for registration? Updated 3/26/21  At vaccinateRI.org, you will first pick the vaccination site you want to go to. Then, you will attest that you meet the eligibility criteria for vaccine. Next, you will enter personal and contact information; for some clinics, your health insurance information (for those who have health insurance. If you do not have health insurance, you can skip this section and still schedule an appointment to be vaccinated for free), and information about your health. You can then search for an appointment slot.    It may be that there are no appointments available. This may happen given that there is still limited vaccine and high demand. More appointments are added every Friday at approximately 5 p.m. and every Tuesday at approximately 9 a.m.   How do I register to get vaccinated if I don’t have a computer? Updated 3/11/21 If you do not have access to a computer, you can call the automated phone line at 844-930-1779. The phone line is available in English and Spanish. At this number, you will request a call back and someone will assist you with your vaccination appointment. You can also call 2-1-1. At 2-1-1, a live, trained person can offer help scheduling appointments on VaccinateRI.org or signing up for the COVID-19 Vaccine Interest Notification List on portal.ri.gov. This help is available in multiple languages, is free to all Rhode Islanders, and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Friends or family can also help you make an appointment. A person may schedule and consent to vaccination, online or on the phone, for someone else with verbal approval. When will all Rhode Islanders be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination? Updated 3/23/21  Based on the projections we are getting from the federal government, we believe that we can open eligibility to the last age group on our timeline (people 16 to 39 years of age) by the week of April 19. We are going to continue the approach of vaccinate in age groups, but the timeline will be accelerated. There are no COVID-19 vaccines approved or authorized in the United States for people under the age of 16.   This does not mean that everyone will be able to get an appointment by April 19. This is when we think we can open eligibility for everyone. Appointments are booking two and three weeks out. Soon, every Rhode Islander will be eligible to make an appointment for a first dose of COVID-19. We are grateful for everyone’s patience during this time.  Does Rhode Island have a waiting list or a pre-registration tool? Updated 3/25/2021  Yes. The Vaccine Interest Notification List (VINL) is a tool that Rhode Islanders can use to learn when they are eligible for vaccination and to learn when there is a vaccination appointment open for them.   You can sign up for the Vaccine Interest Notification List at portal.ri.gov. You will be asked to submit demographic information and how you would prefer to be contacted. You can choose email, text message, or phone call. If you are not able to sign up for VINL online, you can call 844-930-1779 or 2-1-1 and someone will help you over the phone.   When you are eligible and an appointment opens for you, we will contact you using your preferred method. You will be contacted about an appointment approximately two weeks in advance. We will send out notifications every Wednesday, starting April 7.   The appointment offered to you will be for a specific site on a specific day. You will be able to choose the time, based on what is available. The site will be one of the State-run sites (the Dunkin Donuts Center, Sockanosset Cross Road, Middletown, South County, or Woonsocket).   The Vaccine Interest Notification List is just one way to get an appointment. You can still try to make an appointment through vaccinateRI.org, at a local pharmacy, or through your city/town. What happens at my COVID-19 vaccination appointment? Updated 3/3/21 Please show up at your assigned time. Appointments have been spaced out to avoid crowding. If you have registered, there is vaccine for you. You do not need to worry about the clinic running out. Please wear a mask and loose-fitting clothing that allows easy access to your upper arm. Follow social distancing guidelines at your appointment. You will receive a vaccination card that indicates which vaccine you received and the date and location of your vaccination. If you received a vaccine that requires a second dose (e.g., Moderna or Pfizer), the card will also note the earliest date you can receive your second dose. We strongly encourage you to sign up for your second dose while onsite and receiving your first dose. After receiving the vaccine, you will be asked to remain on site for a 15- to 30-minute observation period. You can make your second appointment during this observation period. What happens after my COVID-19 vaccination appointment? Updated 3/3/21 If you received a vaccine that requires a second dose (e.g., Moderna or Pfizer), you are encouraged to schedule your second dose before leaving the vaccination site. You can make your second appointment during your observation period. Vaccines often cause our immune systems to respond in a way that shows the vaccine is working. This is healthy, normal, and expected. You may experience a sore arm, headache, fever, or body aches, but they should go away within a few days. If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 following vaccination, stay home, call a healthcare provider, and get tested. What to expect after you get your vaccine (English only): https://youtu.be/EILCpte7GSw (CDC video) How can I check my vaccination record? Updated 3/17/21  Rhode Islanders can now get a copy of their COVID-19 vaccine record through portal.ri.gov/VaccineRecord. From this website, you can search for and print proof of your COVID-19 vaccination. If you need a second dose of vaccine, this record will tell you when you are eligible to get your second dose. Please note that only people who have received their COVID-19 vaccination in Rhode Island will be able to look up their vaccination record online.   If you are having trouble finding your vaccination record or are not able to go online, you can call 401-222-8022 for help.  We do not currently have the ability to email or mail a vaccine record. Please keep your vaccination card. If you have a smartphone, it is a good idea to take a picture of your vaccination card with your phone so that you always have a copy with you.  I got vaccinated and now have symptoms of COVID-19. What do I do? Updated 2/11/21 After vaccination, people should continue to follow guidance around prevention, testing, quarantine, and isolation. People are likely to experience symptoms after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Here is a list of symptoms and what to do if you experience them: Local symptoms (e.g., redness or swelling where you receive the injection, muscle pain or discomfort in arm) – This is unlikely to be related to COVID-19. It is ok to go to work or school. No additional testing is needed. Generalized symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, whole body muscle aches or joint pain) – These symptoms could be related to either COVID-19 or the COVID-19 vaccine. Please stay home from work or school, call a healthcare provider and get tested for COVID-19. Respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny nose, congestion, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell) – These may be related to COVID-19. Please stay home from work or school, call a healthcare provider and get tested for COVID-19. Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) – These may be related to COVID-19. Please stay home from work or school, call a healthcare provider and get tested for COVID-19. Is there a cost or co-pay for COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 2/17/21 No. COVID-19 vaccines will be provided at no cost. Those who administer vaccines may charge insurance companies a fee for giving the someone the shot, but they will not charge the person being vaccinated. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine even if I don't have health insurance? Updated 2/17/21 Yes, people without health insurance will receive the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost.  Are undocumented immigrants eligible for COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 2/1/21 Yes. Undocumented immigrants are eligible for vaccine in Rhode Island. No questions about immigration status will be asked at vaccination appointments. We do not share information with immigration authorities. *Please note that for vaccinations happening in Central Falls, you may be asked for proof of residency (e.g., identification, driver’s license, utility bill, rent bill). This is because they are prioritizing vaccine for community members. For more information and resources for undocumented immigrants, please see here. How much COVID-19 vaccine does Rhode Island receive? Updated 1/22/21 Vaccine amounts are allocated on a per capita basis by the federal government. How is Rhode Island making decisions about who is eligible for COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 1/26/21 Rhode Island does not yet receive enough vaccine to give to everyone at once. The State’s planning is informed by the National Academies of Medicine, Engineering, and Science’s Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 vaccine; recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Rhode Island COVID-19 Vaccine Subcommittee; new information from CDC and other partners about the availability and safety of various COVID-19 vaccines; and consultation with industry leaders, subject matter experts, and community partners. Equity is a top priority that will continue to inform our vaccine planning. Rhode Island’s COVID-19 Vaccine Subcommittee meets regularly. To receive updates on meetings and meeting minutes, please follow this link to the Secretary of State’s Open Meeting website. Click on the orange box that says “email” to register your email address for automatic updates. How long does it take to give people COVID-19 vaccine after Rhode Island receives vaccine supplies? Updated 1/19/21 Rhode Island administers vaccine at roughly the same rate that the State receives vaccine. But there are several steps between receiving vaccine doses in Rhode Island and getting vaccine into someone’s arm. Those steps, such as recording and allocating specific doses or organizations which are vaccinating, distributing and transport of vaccine from a centralized site, ensuring accountability and logging of each dose and scheduling people for shots, take a few days. For this reason, there will always be a small difference between the number of doses we have received and the number of doses that have been administered. Are doses of COVID-19 vaccine being thrown away or wasted? Vaccines are not going to waste in Rhode Island. Each vaccination site has systems in place to bring people from eligible populations to receive any remaining doses from an opened vial. Is it mandatory to get the COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 3/3/21 The Federal government does not mandate vaccination for individuals. However, some employers may require or mandate staff to be vaccinated. Check with your employer to see if they have rules that apply to you. The Rhode Island Department of Health does not mandate or require people to be vaccinated. This is voluntary. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, highly effective against serious illness, and prevents you from being infected with COVID-19. How are people who are unable to leave home getting vaccinated? Updated 3/23/21  Please note that Rhode Island has access to a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines. Appointments for in-home vaccination are therefore being prioritized based on age and geography. Appointments will be made first for the oldest people and those who live in one of the following high-density communities: 02860, 02861, 02863, 02893, 02895,02904, 02905, 02906, 02907, 02908, 02909, 02910, 02911, 02914, 02919, and 02920.  RIDOH encourages those who can safely attend vaccination opportunities outside the home to do so. Due to limited vaccine supply, requests to vaccinate caregivers during a homebound vaccination appointment will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should only be made in situations where a caregiver leaving the home to seek vaccination will jeopardize the safety or care of the homebound individual. Caregivers who are vaccinated during a homebound vaccination appointment must meet current Rhode Island COVID-19 vaccination eligibility criteria.  If you are unable to leave home to receive COVID-19 vaccination, or are the healthcare provider or family caregiver of someone who is homebound, please inform RIDOH through the following survey: http://bit.ly/homeboundvax.    How do I know if I live in a ZIP code prioritized for vaccination? Updated 3/24/2021  Many Rhode Islanders living in specific geographies have experienced higher rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths throughout the pandemic. Such differences are directly connected to the settings in which some communities of color are more likely to live and work every day, and to systems of structural racism and discrimination that have historically undermined the health and well-being of these communities.   RIDOH believes reaching high vaccination rates across all individuals and communities regardless of ZIP code is key to saving lives and achieving broader population immunity. Rhode Island’s Hard-Hit Community Vaccination Strategy aims to ensure equitable vaccine access by distributing vaccine more quickly and deliberately in the hardest-hit ZIP codes. This includes focused efforts to expand access to and uptake of vaccine among communities of color at highest risk of hospitalization and death. Given the current limitations on vaccine supply, focused strategies are necessary to ensure vaccine access for the most vulnerable members of the hardest-hit areas in the state.  The Hard-Hit Community Vaccination Strategy currently applies to the following ZIP codes in Central Falls, Pawtucket, and Providence: 02863, 02860, 02861, 02904, 02905, 02907, 02908, and 02909.  Learn about Rhode Island's Hard-Hit Community Vaccination Strategy.    If I am a resident of Rhode Island in the summer but another state in the winter, where do I get the COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 3/3/21 To get vaccinated in Rhode Island, you must live in Rhode Island, work in Rhode Island, or go to school in Rhode Island. If you received a vaccine that requires two doses (e.g., Pfizer or Moderna), you should receive both doses in the same state and at the same location. This is because the second dose will be shipped automatically to the healthcare provider or location that gave you the first dose. Can I choose which COVID-19 vaccine I receive? Updated 3/3/21 The best vaccine is the first one available to you. In general, only one vaccine may be available through a healthcare professional or vaccination clinic. Please talk to a healthcare provider if you have specific questions or concerns about one COVID-19 vaccine versus another. I received a COVID-19 vaccine that requires two doses and I missed my appointment for the second dose. What should I do? Updated 3/26/21  If you missed your second-dose appointment or did not schedule it while you were at the site where you received your first dose, please contact [email protected] and ask to schedule or reschedule your second dose appointment.  Guidance from the CDC states that the second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval (21 days after the first dose for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, 28 days for Moderna vaccines) as possible. However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be scheduled for administration up to six weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window. Despite lack of efficacy data, when unavoidable delays occur, the second dose may be administered beyond the six-week window and there is no need to restart the series.   Which underlying conditions will qualify me for a COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 3/26/2021  People with conditions such as diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, and weakened immune systems are eligible for vaccine since they are at higher risk for becoming hospitalized if they get COVID-19. To see the full list of qualifying underlying conditions in Rhode Island, please visit health.ri.gov/underlyingconditions.  Will I need a note from a doctor saying I have an underlying condition? Updated 3/11/2021 No. People must agree that they are age 16 or older and have one or more qualifying underlying medical condition(s) before making a vaccine appointment online or over the phone. They do not need a note from a medical provider. If people have questions about whether their underlying medical condition(s) qualify, they should contact their primary care provider. Do people who are younger than 18 years old need to make appointments at certain vaccination sites? Updated 3/11/2021   If they are making an appointment at a State-run vaccination site, people who are 16 and 17 years old must sign up for a clinic offering Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) are for people 18 years old and older only.  Can I cancel my COVID-19 vaccination appointment? Updated 3/17/2021  You can cancel your COVID-19 vaccination appointment by clicking on the “cancel” option in your confirmation email or by emailing [email protected] with your request.   About COVID-19 Vaccines Do I need a second dose? Updated 3/11/2021 The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines require two doses. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) requires one dose. If you get a first dose of Moderna or Pfizer, it is important to get the second dose because two doses are what was shown to be effective during clinical trials. Should I get the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) or wait until I can get Pfizer or Moderna? Updated 3/11/2021 All three vaccines are safe; highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, and death; and reduce the risk of being infected. All three vaccines will help protect you from getting different variants of COVID-19. If you are eligible to get vaccinated, the best vaccine for you is the one that is available to you first. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective at preventing COVID-19. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 94% effective at preventing COVID-19 among people who received two doses. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Janssen vaccine was 66% effective at preventing COVID-19. In addition, the Janssen vaccine was very effective at preventing hospitalization and death in people who did get sick and may provide protection against asymptomatic infection. It is important to note that comparing the results from the Pfizer and Moderna trials to the results from the Janssen trials is like doing an apples and oranges comparison. This is because the vaccines were tested at different times, in different places, with different groups of people. Further, different strains of the coronavirus were more present than others, depending on where the trials were done. For example, the Janssen vaccine was tested in multiple countries, including South Africa, where the dominant strain is more contagious. The vaccines will continue to be studied over time, so we will have more comparable data in the future. COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Will I get sick with COVID-19 from the vaccine? 3/24/2021 No. Vaccines do not cause COVID-19 disease. However, vaccines can cause your immune system to respond. This is a sign that the vaccine—and your body’s immune system—is working.   We expect people to have symptoms after vaccination with any of the currently available vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, or Janssen). People may feel some soreness in their upper arms, some aches, fever, and fatigue. These symptoms may be more noticeable than those that occur with a flu vaccine. This is completely normal and they will clear up in a few days. Some people may experience no symptoms.   Are COVID-19 vaccines safe? Safety is a top priority. COVID-19 vaccines have been tested in large clinical trials with people of different ages, races, ethnicities, and people with different health conditions to make sure they are safe. No steps involving safety have been skipped—COVID-19 vaccines are being held to the same standards as other vaccines to make sure they are safe. To ensure the safety of all vaccines in the United States, there is a rigorous vaccine development and approval process. Once a vaccine is available for use, there are additional systems in place to continue to ensure safety. What steps are taken to make sure COVID-19 vaccines stay safe? After any vaccine is approved and distributed in the United States, there are systems to monitor their safety. If something unexpected happens, experts study the event to determine whether changes are needed in vaccine recommendations. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national vaccine safety surveillance program of the FDA and CDC. An “adverse event” is any problem or “side effect” that happens after vaccination. VAERS cannot tell if the vaccine caused the event, but can decide whether further investigation is needed. Anyone (healthcare providers, patients, family members, etc.) can submit a report to VAERS by going to this link: https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.  There are several other systems to monitor vaccine safety. You can learn more about vaccine safety monitoring at the CDC’s page on Ensuring the Safety of Vaccines: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html What is v-safe? V-safe is a smartphone-based tool—developed by CDC—that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Through v-safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Depending on your answers, someone from CDC may call to check on you and get more information. And v-safe will remind you to get your second COVID-19 vaccine dose if you need one. Your participation in CDC’s v-safe makes a difference—it helps keep COVID-19 vaccines safe. For more on v-safe, visit CDC’s site. Was the vaccine tested with people like me? Updated 3/11/2021 The COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized were tested in large clinical trials with people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, as well as people with different underlying health conditions. Nearly half (42%) of Moderna’s study participants belong to high-risk groups. This means that they are older than 65 or have chronic conditions like diabetes, severe obesity, and cardiac disease. More than one third (37%) of study participants belong to communities of color. Ten percent of people who enrolled in both the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials are Black. Demographic and age information from Pfizer clinical trials can be found here, demographic and age information from Moderna clinical trials can be found here, and demographic and age information from the Janssen clinical trials can be found here.   Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for children? Updated 3/26/21  The Pfizer vaccine has been authorized for people 16 years old and older. The Moderna vaccine and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) have been authorized for people 18 years old and older. Both Moderna and Pfizer have started clinical trials for their COVID-19 vaccines in children. They hope to have results by late summer 2021.   COVID-19 Vaccine and Contraindications   Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I have allergies? Updated 3/24/21  If you have allergies that are not related to vaccines (e.g., food allergies, pet allergies, latex allergies), the CDC recommends that you receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Please discuss with a healthcare provider if you have any questions.    If you have had an allergic reaction to other types of vaccines, CDC recommends that you speak with a healthcare provider about whether to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.   If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.   If you have had a severe or immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson& Johnson), you should not get the Janssen vaccine.   Learn more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines and their ingredients on the CDC website.   If you have an allergic reaction to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, CDC recommends that you should not get the second dose. Examples of allergic reactions include hives, swelling, wheezing, dizziness and weakness, and reactions that need to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen© or hospital care.  If you are not able to get the second shot of an mRNA vaccine because you had an allergic reaction to the first shot, ask your doctor if you should get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine.   For more information, please see CDC’s recommendations for people with allergies: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reac… and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-consider…    What is a “severe” allergic reaction? What is an “immediate” allergic reaction? Updated 3/24/21  An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen© or if they must go to the hospital. An example of a severe reaction is anaphylacis.   An immediate allergic reaction means a reaction within four hours of getting vaccinated, and includes symptoms like hives, swelling, or wheezing (respiratory distress).   Can I receive the COVID-19 vaccine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding? Updated 3/25/21  Pregnant and breastfeeding women can be vaccinated if they choose, after they have had the opportunity to discuss risks and benefits with their healthcare providers. This recommendation applies to Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines.  Based on how these vaccines work in the body, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people.  Clinical trials that look at safety and how well the COVID-19 vaccines work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also monitoring data from people in the clinical trials who received vaccine and became pregnant.  Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns.  CDC and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor that information. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing, so we don’t yet have information on the outcomes of these pregnancies. We need to continue to follow pregnancies long-term to understand effects on pregnancy and infants.  The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and, therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA or cause genetic changes because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept.   The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning it uses a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Viral vector technology has been used by Janssen for other vaccine development programs. Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes that affected the infant, were associated with vaccination in these trials.   For more, see CDC’s page on COVID-19 vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I already had COVID-19? Updated 1/4/21 Yes, you should still get the COVID-19 vaccine. We do not know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I currently have COVID-19? Updated 1/4/21 No, you cannot get the COVID-19 vaccine if you are currently infected. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you must wait until you have completed your isolation period and are considered recovered. It is uncommon for people who do get COVID-19 again to get it within 90 days of when they recovered from their first infection. For this reason, you can delay your vaccination until 90 days after infection, if you would like. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I just received a different vaccine (e.g., Shingrix)? Updated 12/17/20 People who have received any other vaccine should wait until 14 days have passed to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Can I take medications before receiving my vaccine to prevent post-vaccination symptoms? Updated 2/26/21   Taking antihistamines or fever-reducing medications before vaccination is not recommended. This is because there is not enough information on their impact on mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, and because they could prevent you from noticing a symptom of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. However, you may take fever-reducing medications after vaccination, if medically appropriate. Vaccine and COVID-19 Prevention  How long does it take for the COVID-19 vaccines to provide immunity (protection)? Updated 3/11/2021 People are considered fully vaccinated two or more weeks after they have received the second dose of a two-dose series (for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines) or two or more weeks after they have received the single dose of the Janssen vaccine. Do I still need to wear a mask after I’ve been vaccinated? Updated 2/25/2021 Yes, you will need to wear a mask after being vaccinated. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, highly effective against serious illness, and prevents you from being infected with COVID-19. Get vaccinated when it's available to you.  Because there may still be a small chance you can become infected and spread the virus to others, once you've gotten any COVID-19 vaccine, please continue to wear your mask and watch your distance around anyone you don't live with. Do I still need to practice social distancing? Updated 2/25/21 Yes, you still need to practice social distancing after vaccination. Because there still may be a small chance you can become infected and spread the virus to others, once you’ve gotten any COVID-19 vaccine, please continue to wear your mask and watch your distance around anyone you don’t live with. Do I need to quarantine if I have been fully vaccinated and am later identified as a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19? Updated 3/23/21  If you’ve been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 or you’ve recently arrived in Rhode Island from outside the 50 states or the District of Columbia (DC) or from a hot spot within the 50 states or DC, you do not need to quarantine if:  You’ve gotten a final dose of COVID-19 vaccine, that is either FDA approved or received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), at least 14 days before your last exposure or out-of-state travel and  You haven’t had symptoms of COVID-19 since your last exposure or out-of-state travel.  Always watch for symptoms for a full 14 days. Vaccinated travelers are encouraged to get a COVID-19 test between 5 and 10 days after their last exposure or out-of-state travel. Vaccinated hospitalized patients and long-term care facility residents must still quarantine for 14 days.  Nothing changes with isolation: Do I need to isolate if I test positive on a respiratory specimen (nasal swab) after I am vaccinated? Updated 1/4/21 Yes, you must isolate if you test positive for COVID-19 whether or not you have received a vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine does not in any way interfere with PCR or rapid testing from a respiratory specimen. If you test positive after receiving the vaccine, please seek guidance from your/a healthcare provider. Do I get better protection against another COVID-19 infection from COVID-19 vaccines or from getting and recovering from COVID-19? Updated 1/11/21 The protection someone gains from having an infection (called “natural immunity”) is different by disease and by person. Because this is a new virus, we don’t know how long natural immunity might last. Early evidence suggests that it may not last very long. Also, we don’t yet know how long immunity lasts from vaccination, because these vaccines are new and we are still collecting data over time. Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are learning more about. The CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. Can I travel without quarantining if I have been fully vaccinated? Updated 1/4/21 Vaccinated persons should continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves and others, including following CDC travel guidance. International Travelers: Not all countries have started vaccinating their populations, so continue to follow COVID-19 guidelines such as mask wearing and social distancing when you travel. Different governments across the world are likely to have different protocols for travelers to prove their vaccination status and to test and/or quarantine if they been not been vaccinated, so check the guidelines of the country you plan to visit before traveling. Domestic Travelers: Quarantine restrictions and rules will continue to vary depending on which state you are traveling to. To learn more about the current restrictions that are in place, check with the health department of the state you are traveling to. COVID-19 Vaccine and Testing Do I need to get tested for COVID-19 before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine? Updated 3/3/21 No, you do not need to get tested for COVID-19 before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. If you are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or are currently infected with COVID-19, you should not get vaccine until after you have completed your quarantine or isolation requirements. This recommendation applies to people who develop COVID-19 infection before receiving any doses and those who develop COVID-19 infection after the first dose (of a vaccine requiring two doses) but before the second dose. If you were scheduled to receive a COVID-19 vaccine while you are still in isolation or quarantine, you will need to cancel or reschedule for after you have completed isolation. After ending quarantine or isolation, you do not need to wait for any specific length of time before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. You may choose to delay vaccination for up to 90 days after infection. This is because you will likely have a short-term immunity to COVID-19 after infection (it is rare that people become infected again with COVID-19 in the 90 days following their first infection). I received a COVID-19 vaccine dose and then tested positive for COVID-19. What does this mean? If you test positive for COVID-19 on a respiratory specimen (nasal swab), you have COVID-19 infection and must isolate whether or not you have received a vaccine. There are two types of tests for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests. Viral tests (i.e., PCR or rapid antigen tests), such as nasal swab test, test for current infection. Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in trials in the United States cause positive viral test results.  Antibody tests check the blood for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. If your body develops an immune response following a COVID-19 vaccine—which is the goal of vaccination—an antibody test may come back positive. Positive antibody test results also indicate that you may have previously been exposed to the virus causing COVID-19. A positive antibody test result does not necessarily mean you have protective immunity. There is no way to tell whether a positive antibody test is from a previous infection or from vaccination. Experts are looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results. Do I need to participate in routine surveillance testing for my employment if I have been vaccinated? Updated 2/25/21 Yes, you must continue to participate in surveillance testing even after being vaccinated. Because there still may be a small chance you can become infected and spread the virus to others, once you’ve gotten any COVID-19 vaccine, please continue to wear your mask and watch your distance around anyone you don’t live with. Please also continue to take part in required and optional testing at your workplace and elsewhere.  COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I received monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19? Updated 12/17/20 The CDC advises waiting 90 days after monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma treatment before receiving COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 Vaccine Authorization and Approval How do vaccines get approved? Vaccines go through three phases of clinical trial. Each phase tests for safety and effectiveness across an increasing number of test volunteers. In Phase 1, vaccines are tested by approximately 20 to 100 people. In Phase 2, vaccines are tested by several hundred volunteers. In Phase 3, vaccines are tested by thousands of volunteers. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will only approve a vaccine if it is safe, effective, and if its benefits outweigh its risks. What is an Emergency Use Authorization? Updated 3/3/21 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is an authority that allows the FDA to make certain medical products (e.g., vaccines, treatments) available during public health emergencies. It also can allow the use of medical products that have been approved, but for use in a different way than originally intended. An EUA lasts for the length of an emergency. A regular FDA approval lasts forever, unless a safety or efficacy issue comes up that needs further review. The FDA has authorized COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen for emergency use. What criteria are needed to issue an EUA? To issue an EUA: The known and potential benefits of a drug, device, or test must outweigh the risks. The drug, device, or test must meet certain thresholds for safety and effectiveness. People must be in urgent need of care. How do we know that drugs, devices, or tests that have received EUAs are safe? The FDA released guidance for vaccine manufacturers considering requests for an EUA. This guidance explains the criteria that need to be met before any vaccine for COVID-19 will receive an EUA. To meet criteria, manufacturers will use data from a Phase 3 clinical trial. The vaccine’s potential and known benefits must outweigh the potential and known risks. In addition, the vaccine must be at least 50% effective and must meet certain safety standards among a sufficiently large group of volunteers. The FDA will also consult with an independent advisory committee before issuing an EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine. Granting an EUA does not mean that vaccine clinical trials will stop. Data can continue to be collected through trials even if an EUA is granted. For more on EUAs, visit the FDA web pages on Emergency Use Authorization and FAQs on Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Devices - COVID-19. Is the COVID-19 vaccine development and approval process different from a typical vaccine development and approval process? The COVID-19 vaccines are being held to the same standards as other vaccines to make sure they are safe. No steps involving safety have been skipped. There are some differences in other processes that have made COVID-19 vaccines available much faster than a typical vaccine. Importantly, there has been much collaboration across the scientific community to develop a vaccine. This is a global pandemic. As a result, a lot of time and resources from across the globe have gone into developing several COVID-19 vaccines. Further, researchers had a head start on vaccine development because of research already done on similar coronaviruses. This includes the viruses that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Also, the government began producing doses of certain COVID19 vaccines when they reached Phase 3 trials. This way, when these vaccines were determined to be safe and effective, people could get them immediately.   COVID-19 Vaccine: Addressing Misinformation There is a lot of information about COVID-19 vaccines. It can be difficult to know which sources of information to trust. Here are some suggestions for where and how you can look for accurate and trustworthy vaccine information. Is the Janssen vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) less effective than the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? Updated 3/4/21 All three vaccines are safe; highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, and death; and reduce the risk of being infected. All three vaccines will help protect you from getting different variants of COVID-19. If you are eligible to get vaccinated, the best vaccine for you is the one that is available to you first. Comparing the results from the Pfizer and Moderna trials to the results from the Janssen trials is like doing an apples and oranges comparison. This is because the vaccines were tested at different times, in different places, with different groups of people. Further, different strains of the coronavirus were more present than others, depending on where the trials were done. For example, the Janssen vaccine was tested in multiple countries, including South Africa, where the dominant strain is more contagious. The vaccines will continue to be studied over time, so we will have more comparable data in the future. Does the vaccine contain a microchip? Updated 1/11/21 No. There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will not track people or gather personal information into a database. This myth started after comments made by Bill Gates from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation about a digital certificate of vaccine records. The technology he was referencing is not a microchip, has not been implemented in any manner, and is not tied to the development, testing, or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.   Can mRNA vaccines change your DNA? Updated 3/3/21 No. The COVID-19 vaccines that use messenger RNA (mRNA) (Pfizer and Moderna), will not change your DNA. Messenger RNA vaccines work by instructing cells in the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response, according to CDC. Messenger RNA injected into your body does not enter the cell nucleus, which is where DNA is kept. The mRNA do not interact with DNA in any way. Human cells break down and get rid of the mRNA soon after they have finished using the instructions. Will the vaccine give you COVID-19? Updated 1/11/21 No. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development or in use in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. The goal for each of the vaccines is to teach our immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it’s possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick, but this is not because they got the vaccine. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.   Is it better to get natural immunity to COVID-19? Updated 1/19/21 It is unclear how long immunity lasts after natural infection after recovering from COVID-19. However, people who get COVID-19 can have serious illnesses, and some have debilitating symptoms that persist for months. Vaccination is the best protection, and it is safe. Will the flu vaccine protect me from COVID-19? Updated 1/11/21 No. Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19; however, flu vaccination has many other important benefits. Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death. Getting a flu vaccine this season will be more important than ever, not only to reduce your risk from flu but also to help conserve potentially scarce healthcare resources. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I am Catholic? Updated 3/3/21 Yes. In a March 2 statement, chairmen of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and the Committee on Pro-Life Activities state that it is morally acceptable to receive COVID-19 vaccines. For more information on this, please see: Moral Considerations Regarding the New COVID-19 Vaccines (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) Answers to Key Ethical Questions About COVID-19 Vaccines (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) Note of the Vatican Covid-19 Commission in collaboration with the Pontifical Academy for Life “Vaccine for all. 20 points for a fairer and healthier world” (Vatican Covid-19 Commission in collaboration with the Pontifical Academy for Life) Will the COVID-19 vaccine cause me to test positive for COVID-19? Updated 1/11/21 No. Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the US cause you to test positive on viral tests (for example a nasal swab), which are used to see if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results. Will the COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility? Updated 1/22/21 No, the COVID-19 vaccines do not cause infertility. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccine causes increased risk of infertility, first or second trimester loss, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies of any kind. Several national medical organizations have put out statements that say as much, such as this statement from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. CDC has also shared information on vaccines during pregnancy here. Teachers, School Staff, and Licensed Child Care Providers How can a teacher or child care worker sign up? You will be vaccinated at the municipal clinic that covers the city/town where you work. School leaders and licensed child care providers will be working directly with municipalities to schedule staff for vaccination. Your school or child care facility will share more information with you about how to make an appointment. Anyone who works in Providence should call 401-444-8139 (starting Wednesday, March 10) to make an appointment. Who is included in this group of eligible people? The municipal vaccination sites are for teachers, staff, and licensed child care providers. For schools, eligible individuals include anyone providing regular, direct service to students, including teachers, administrative and clerical staff, bus drivers/monitors, coaches, cafeteria staff, maintenance staff, therapists working in schools, substitute teachers, and student teachers. School Committee members are not eligible. For licensed child care providers, eligible individuals include all employees (regardless of schedule and hours of employment) who deliver direct, in-person services to children in DHS-licensed child care settings, maintenance staff, security and transportation personnel, and therapists and support staff. Anyone who has a question about their eligibility should contact their employer (school or child care facility).  What if my specific community does not have a municipal clinic? Where do I go for information on which clinic I can go to? There are 31 municipal vaccination sites. Some of the smaller communities have partnered to vaccinate the teachers and child care providers who work in their city or town. Your school or child care facility will share more information with you about how to make an appointment. Will you get vaccinated in the municipality where you live or work? You will be vaccinated at the municipal vaccination site that covers the city/town where you work. I am a Providence teacher. Is there a different process for me than other people? If so, what is that process? Teachers and staff who work at public, private, parochial, and independent schools in Providence and early child care providers licensed by DHS who work at a facility in Providence will be vaccinated at Lifespan Community Health Institute at 335R Prairie Ave., Suite 1B. To schedule an appointment, call 401-444-8139 starting on Wednesday, March 10. If your call is not answered live, leave a message that clearly states your name, phone number, and date of birth. Calls will be returned within two business days.  Can teachers/child care providers sign up through other channels (State-run vaccination sites, pharmacies, other community-based clinics)? If you are a teacher and are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination because of your age or where you live, you can make an appointment to be vaccinated through other available channels. If your job as a teacher is what makes you eligible to be vaccinated, you can only make an appointment to be vaccinated at CVS or Walgreens or at the municipal site that covers the city or town where you work. How will eligibility be verified at the vaccination clinics? People who have scheduled appointments will be checked against staff lists that will be provided by the schools and child care facilities. Family child care (FCC) providers can show a state ID (or driver’s license, passport, etc.) to validate their identification. FCC providers can also show their family child care license (current and issued by the Department of Human Services) to validate their employment/identification. Center-based child care: The State does not have an active registry of currently employed child care staff. Employers (center administrators/directors) will need to provide all staff with a letter (preferably on their letterhead) that validates an individual’s employment and includes the following information: employer name and address (as it appears on their DHS license), staff name, employer signature and date. Will I have to pay for the vaccine? All vaccines are free of charge regardless of the individual’s healthcare access/participation. You can still get a vaccine without insurance. That said, all individuals should bring their health insurance card (if available) to the appointment. Which vaccine will municipalities receive to vaccinate school and child care staff? Municipalities will receive vaccine based on available supply. At this time, we expect most staff to receive the Pfizer vaccine. Are vaccines required of school or child care staff? Not at this time; however, all staff are strongly encouraged to participate in this opportunity. If I have staff who have already received a vaccine, or are eligible through a different mechanism (such as age) do I need to report their vaccinations to RIDOH or DHS? No. You should maintain these records as required (determined) by your HR department. Does RIDOH and/or DHS need documentation of our staff’s completed vaccinations? No. You should maintain these records as required (determined) by your HR department.

The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 11, 2020, and South Carolina received its first allocation of this vaccine on December 14, 2020. The FDA issued an EUA for the Moderna vaccine on December 18, 2020, and South Carolina received its first allocation of Moderna vaccine the week of December 28, 2020. The FDA issued an EUA on for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine on February 27, 2021, and South Carolina received its first allocation of this vaccine the week of March 1. Will the COVID vaccine cover any new strains of the COVID? Health experts and scientists have been monitoring the presence and significance of various genetic strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus since the beginning of the pandemic. Scientists are still working to better understand how widespread the latest variants of interest are and their impacts on existing therapies, vaccines, and tests. Early research indicates that the currently available mRNA-based vaccines provide a level of protection from COVID-19 disease, but the full impact is still being evaluated. Click here to learn the latest about variants from CDC. How long does the vaccine last (is it like the flu shot that you have to get every year)? It is not yet clear how long natural and vaccine-induced immunity lasts and whether additional doses of vaccine will be required in the future. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are reportedly developing a booster vaccine that could be used if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 shows evidence that the vaccines are not effective enough against them. Click here to learn the latest about variants from CDC. Which vaccine will be available first? The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 11, 2020, and South Carolina received its first allocation of this vaccine on December 14, 2020. The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the Moderna vaccine on December 18, 2020, and South Carolina received its first allocation of Moderna vaccine the week of December 28, 2020. How do the vaccines work? There is no COVID-19 virus in vaccines. The vaccines help your body make antibodies to a protein on the virus surface. This allows your immune system to attack the virus and fight off severe illness if you are exposed. Is the COVID-19 vaccine a live vaccine? No, the vaccines don’t contain live, attenuated, or inactivated vaccines. The vaccines contain the gene for a virus protein only. This means you can’t get COVID-19 from the vaccine. What is in the COVID-19 vaccine? You can’t get COVID-19 from the vaccine. Vaccine components include: Active Ingredient nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Gene for spike protein plus weakened “cold” virus for viral vector vaccines (Janssen vaccine) Four lipids (including polyethylene glycol or PEG) PEG is used in laxatives and in bowel preparation used before colonoscopy and is the most likely component to cause symptoms or allergic reaction Four salts (including NaCl) which act as a pH buffer Sugar (sucrose) Polysorbate 80 commonly used in foods such as some ice creams, puddings, gelatin, etc. (component of Janssen Vaccine) Current COVID-19 vaccine does not contain thimerosal, mercury, aluminum, egg, adjuvants, antibiotics, or preservatives. Are COVID-19 vaccines safe? Yes. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. No vaccine will be released until it has passed the same tough scientific and clinical testing that all vaccines in development are held to. How can a safe vaccine be made so quickly? Vaccine development usually takes many years, however, scientists had already begun research for coronavirus vaccines during previous outbreaks caused by related coronaviruses, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). That earlier research provided a head start for rapid development of vaccines to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19. What are the side effects of the vaccine? After receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, you may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. Side effects are typically mild to moderate, occur within the first 3 days beginning the day of the vaccination, and resolve within 1-2 days of onset. Some people have no side effects. Common side effects on the arm where you received the shot include pain, redness, and swelling. Throughout the rest of your body, you may feel tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. For more information, please see the CDC's Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine. What is an Emergency Use Authorization? The FDA can issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow the use of unapproved medical products (or unapproved uses of approved medical products) in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when specific criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Manufactures submit a request for an EUA to the FDA which is reviewed, and a determination is made by the FDA about authorizing the EUA. I have diabetes. What side effects of the vaccine should I pay attention to? In general, people with diabetes do not have more severe or different side effects than others. However, you may experience some changes in your blood glucose (sugar) control. It is smart to plan ahead just in case. Keep a sick-day kit with extra medications and supplies just in case you do not feel well. You may want to monitor your blood glucose more closely. If you use insulin, consult with your physician about whether you should adjust your insulin if needed. Vaccine Availability Who can get the vaccine? Beginning March 31, 2021, all South Carolinians aged 16 and older are eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. Do I need to prove that I’m eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine? No. You won’t need to prove that you are eligible. You don't need to show an ID or paperwork to prove your age, job, or medical condition. Which vaccine is available for those under the age of 18? Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for those who are 16 and older, and the Moderna and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines are authorized for those who are 18 and older. As of now, no COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for those under the age of 16 although clinic trials for 15 and younger are underway. Will 16- or 17-year-olds need parent/guardian permission to receive the Pfizer vaccine, or will they need to be accompanied to a vaccine appointment by a parent/guardian? In South Carolina, individuals 16 and older are able to consent to vaccination without parental permission. They do not need to be accompanied to a vaccine appointment by a parent or guardian. How will I know when I can get the vaccine? DHEC and its partners will notify the public using several communication methods – news release, website and social media updates – as well as public service announcements; print, radio and TV ads, community-level outreach, direct mailers and other forms of outreach to ensure South Carolinians know when it’s their time to receive vaccine. Health care providers will also notify their patients. Is there a website where I can register to get on the list to receive vaccine? At this time, those eligible to be vaccinated should make an appointment at a location currently offering appointments. You can use our vax locator map to find the contact location for a facility near you or call DHEC's COVID-19 Vaccine Information Line at 1-866-365-8110 between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. seven days a week. For general questions about COVID-19 call the Care Line at 1-855-472-3432 from a 7 a.m.-7 p.m. daily. The Care Line can't schedule an appointment for you. Where can I find the plan for Phase 1b vaccine distribution? An estimated timeline of vaccine phases is available here. This timeline is subject to change based on vaccine ability and other factors. How much will it cost me to get a vaccine? The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States. Vaccination providers can be reimbursed for vaccine administration fees by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund. No one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay a vaccine administration fee, and no one should receive a bill for receiving the vaccine.​ Anyone who has received their vaccine and has a question about any charges, fees or associated costs should contact their vaccine provider. Do I need insurance to get a COVID-19 vaccine? No. You don’t need insurance. A provider can't deny you a vaccine if you don’t have insurance. Why is a vaccine provider asking for a health insurance card? A provider may get reimbursed for giving you a vaccine. They need your health insurance card to seek payment. Your health insurance company or the federal government may pay a fee. You won't pay any out-of-pocket costs for a COVID-19 vaccine. You won't pay deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments. You DON’T have to provide an insurance card to get a COVID-19 vaccine. How will the COVID-19 vaccines be administered? COVID-19 vaccines will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection, a shot in the arm. Will more than one dose of COVID-19 vaccine be required? The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two shots 21 days apart. The Moderna vaccine requires two shots 28 days apart. You must receive both shots of the same type of vaccine: either two shots of Pfizer or two shots of Moderna. The Janssen vaccine only requires one shot. How will I know when to get my second dose? After receiving your first shot, everyone will receive a paper immunization record that will be completed at the time of vaccination. It will include the vaccine you received, date and location, and date when your next shot is needed. Individuals will be reminded when it’s time to receive their second shot. The vaccine you receive and when you need the second dose is confidential health information that is carefully managed to protect your privacy. I'm fully vaccinated, do I still need to quarantine? Maybe. A number of factors would determine whether or not you're required to quarantine. The most up-to-date guidance can be found on the CDC website. Will people who have already had COVID-19 be able to get the vaccine? Once they have completed their isolation period, people previously infected with COVID-19 may receive the vaccine. According to the CDC, people appear to become susceptible to reinfection after more than 90 days from the time they were initially infected. Reinfection appears to be rare during the first 90 days after someone was infected with COVID-19.  Can I get more than one COVID-19 vaccine? It’s recommended that you receive both shots of only one type of COVID-19 vaccine.  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require two doses/shots, and you must receive both doses/shots of the same brand of vaccine. Receiving both doses/shots of both vaccines hasn’t been tested, so there isn’t safety data available. I live in South Carolina part of the year. Can I get vaccinated here? Yes. Non-permanent residents who are living in South Carolina at the time they are eligible to receive vaccine can be vaccinated here, just as South Carolinians staying in another state can receive their vaccine there. While there is currently no need for proof of residency in order to receive the vaccine, it’s advised that you receive both doses from the same vaccine provider. Is the vaccine safe for pregnant women? The Society for Fetal and Maternal Medicine recommends women who are prioritized for initial vaccination be offered the vaccine if pregnant. While pregnant women were excluded from national vaccine trials, it’s understood that the theoretical risk of fetal harm from these vaccines is very low. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not contain a live virus.  Additional information and resources about COVID-19 vaccine and pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are available here and here.  When and how will people who are high risk get the vaccine? DHEC’s number one goal is prevent additional loss of life due to COVID-19. Because COVID-19 vaccines currently are so limited in our state and across the country, those who are most vulnerable to death or severe complications if they contract COVID-19 are prioritized to receive vaccine first. This includes the front-line medical workers who help keep us alive, long-term care facility residents and staff, and anyone who is 70 and older. Phase 1a individuals can contact a hospital or health care facility to schedule their vaccine appointments. An estimated timeline of who will be included in each phase of the state’s vaccination plan is available here. This information is subject to change based on vaccine availability and other factors. My company should be considered in the essential businesses group The South Carolina Vaccine Advisory Committee reviews federal recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to develop recommendations for vaccine administration that are specific to South Carolina. DHEC and other state leaders use those recommendations to adopt the state’s vaccine phases. These recommendations and guidelines are carefully developed to consider all South Carolinians and the most fair and equitable ways to provide limited doses of COVID-19 vaccine. I have an autoimmune disease. Can I get the vaccine? People with autoimmune conditions may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for them. People with autoimmune conditions were included in the Phase 3 studies for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and no flares of disease were seen. However, this represents only a small number of people. As more vaccine is administered, the CDC and FDA will have more information on the risk of an inflammatory response (flare) for a person with autoimmune disease. There is strong evidence from the clinical trials, however, that taking the vaccine greatly reduces the chance that a person will get COVID-19, which can be a serious or even fatal illness. I had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Can I get the vaccine? Persons who have previously had GBS may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. To date, no cases of GBS have been reported following vaccination among participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) general best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines. I’ve had Bell’s palsy. Will getting vaccinated bring it back? Cases of Bell’s palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded these cases were caused by vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Bell’s Palsy may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. I got my 1st dose but can’t get my second dose on time. What should I do? Get your second dose/shot as close as possible to the recommended timeframe. For Pfizer, get your second shot 21 days after your first dose. For Moderna, get your second shot 28 days after your first shot. The CDC advises it’s OK if the second dose of vaccine needs to be delayed past the recommended timeframe. There is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. It is best to get the second dose as close to on time as possible, but it is OK if it is delayed. CDC recommends getting the second dose within 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. If 2nd dose is given beyond 42 days, there is no need to restart the series. What if a person gets COVID-19 in between vaccine doses 1 and 2? If you were to get COVID-19 in between doses of vaccine, you should wait until your acute illness is over and you’ve completed your isolation period. Your doctor will provide more information and recommendations specifically for you. If a person gets COVID-19 in between vaccine doses 1 and 2, can they still get monoclonal antibodies? This is a decision to be made with your doctor. There is no data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in persons who receive monoclonal antibodies. In theory, if you get the passive antibodies, your body might not get long-lasting immunity from the vaccine. CDC’s recommendation if you get passive antibodies is to wait at least 90 days before getting the vaccine How can I protect my children if they can’t get the vaccine? COVID-19 vaccines are not approved in people under age 16. There is some evidence that other vaccines, specifically MMR and Pneumovax, can help protect against COVID-19. These are routine pediatric vaccines. Check with your pediatrician to make sure your children are up to date on their vaccinations, and if they are not, talk to your health care provider about catching up on these vaccines. Do I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others if I have gotten 2 doses of the vaccine? Yes. Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from others, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Vaccine Planning, Shipping and Storage Is DHEC planning for COVID-19 vaccine distribution? Following federal guidance, South Carolina has been planning and preparing for COVID-19 vaccine since the summer of 2020. DHEC has collaborated with the S.C. Emergency Management Division; S.C. Hospital Association; National Guard; S.C. Law Enforcement Division; Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation; and other public and private sector partners to develop South Carolina’s interim Vaccine Plan. In addition, the South Carolina Vaccine Advisory Committee (VAC) helps provide recommendations for the fair and ethical distribution of vaccines across the state. What is the South Carolina Vaccine Advisory Committee? The South Carolina Vaccine Advisory Committee (VAC) is a diverse group of stakeholders who help guide vaccine planning that’s specific to South Carolina. VAC members include health care and vaccine providers as well as individuals who represent the state’s various communities, including the population groups that are at increased risk for COVID-19.  Can any pharmacy or clinic offer the COVID-19 vaccine? To receive and administer the COVID-19 vaccine and supplies, providers must enroll in a federal vaccine distribution program, coordinated through the state immunization program (unless they are part of a national chain that registered directly with the CDC). The federal government distributes the vaccine and ancillary supplies at no cost to enrolled providers. Walgreens and CVS pharmacies have enrolled directly in the federal CDC Long-Term Care Program for vaccinating long-term care facility residents and staff. What are the storage and handling requirements for the COVID-19 vaccines? Vaccines must be stored and handled properly from the time they’re manufactured until they are administered to individuals. The CDC and the vaccines’ manufacturers provide detailed information for the safe handling and storage of COVID-19 vaccines. Find more information here. How will DHEC track vaccine distribution and administration? Vaccine providers are required to log and record specific information about every dose of COVID-19 vaccine they administer. This information is recorded into one of two federal systems: Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS) and Tiberius. South Carolina also has a comprehensive state immunization information system known as SIMON (Statewide Immunization Online Network) that provides a secure system to track vaccines, access vaccine records, order vaccines, and manage vaccine inventory. Vaccine Providers How do you address vaccine hesitancy? The CDC, DHEC and other public health organizations recognize why some people are hesitant to receive the vaccine. Addressing vaccine hesitancy is part of South Carolina's and the CDC's public outreach campaign and is achieved by providing factual and current information to the public. DHEC will continue to share important messaging about the vaccine from our state's top medical leaders as well as share federal resources, like the CDC's Vaccine with Confidence campaign that promotes public of knowledge of vaccine development and distribution. We are working to share this information at the community level through essential partnerships with key community groups, including the business community, faith-based organizations, schools and universities, and many others. Will there be a required observation period after vaccination? Providers should observe patients for 15 minutes after they receive the vaccine. For vaccine administered in drive-by venues, adequate parking must be ensured so those receiving vaccine have a place to wait post-vaccination. Persons who have had severe allergic reactions to other vaccines should be observed for 30 minutes. Persons who have had a severe allergic reaction to a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine should not receive the second dose. Is there guidance for administering vaccines in a setting other than a doctor’s office (e.g., pharmacies; temporary, off-site, or satellite clinics; and large-scale influenza clinics)? Yes. Guidance has been developed for giving vaccines at pharmacies, temporary, off-site, or satellite clinics, and large-scale influenza clinics. Other approaches to vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic may include drive-through immunization services at fixed sites, curbside clinics, mobile outreach units, and home visits. Please collaborate these plans with Local Public Health. The general principles outlined for healthcare facilities should also be applied to alternative vaccination sites, with additional precautions for social distancing that are particularly relevant for large-scale clinics, such as: Providing specific appointment times or other strategies to manage patient flow and avoid crowding. Ensuring sufficient staff and resources to help move patients through the clinic as quickly as possible. Limiting the overall number of patients at any given time, particularly for populations at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. What is the recommendation for receiving flu vaccine this fall/winter with the current COVID-19 pandemic? In accordance with the CDC, DHEC recommends that everyone six months and older receive a yearly flu vaccine. During this COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses is especially important in order to protect vulnerable populations at risk for severe illness and reduce hospitalizations. Healthcare providers should offer flu vaccine at every opportunity all eligible patients. Can other vaccines, including flu vaccines, be administered at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccines? CDC has recommended that no other vaccines be given 2 weeks before or after a COVID-19 vaccine. Should flu vaccines be given to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? Flu vaccine should not be given to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If suspected, get tested. If confirmed, wait until you have completed your isolation period and have no fever before getting vaccinated Are there any contraindications with providing COVID-19 vaccine while someone is being treated with antivirals for influenza? Contraindications to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine include allergy to any of the vaccine components or severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to another vaccine or injection (sub-cutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous). There are no known interactions or contraindications to receiving antivirals for influenza, but this was not specifically tested in Phase 3 studies. Is there guidance for safely administering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic? CDC has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. This guidance is intended to help immunization providers in a variety of clinical and alternative settings with the safe administration of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance will be continually reassessed and updated based on the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States. Interim guidance: immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Vaccination and COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance During a Pandemic Protective Measures for Vaccinating During Pandemic Are there specific infection control procedures to follow when administering vaccines during a pandemic? It’s important to apply infection prevention strategies to all patient encounters including social distancing, respiratory and hand hygiene, surface decontamination, and source control. The CDC has developed General Practices for Safe Delivery of Vaccination Services and the Immunization Action Coalition has developed Protective Measures for Vaccinating During Pandemic. Will the COVID-19 vaccine be mandatory for health care providers? Similar to flu vaccine requirements, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccine in health care settings will be determined by individual facilities. DHEC highly recommends vaccination for all health care workers caring for persons with COVID-19 or those at high risk for severe disease (e.g., those working in long-term care facilities).

Let’s set the record straight on myths circulating about the COVID-19 vaccine.  Fiction: The COVID-19 vaccines were developed using fetal tissueFact: NO vaccines are developed using fetal tissue. Some vaccines are developed using cell cultures, but current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were not developed in that way.  Fact: NO vaccines are developed using fetal tissue. Some vaccines are developed using cell cultures, but current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were not developed in that way.  Fiction: The COVID-19 vaccine will alter my DNAFact: The current COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.  mRNA is not able to change a person’s genetic makeup (DNA). The COVID-19 vaccines give a “recipe” to the body that is used for a short time to make a protein that is found on the virus that causes COVID-19. The body sees that protein doesn’t belong, makes antibodies to the protein, and when the body someday sees the virus it remembers the protein and knows to destroy it.    Fact: The current COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.  mRNA is not able to change a person’s genetic makeup (DNA).

On this page:  Basics Safety Vaccine Availability in Texas More Information Effectiveness Vaccine Provider FAQs Immunity General COVID-19 FAQs Getting Vaccinated Basics How are the COVID-19 vaccines different from other vaccines? Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But every type of vaccine works by teaching our bodies how to make cells that trigger an immune response. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. Currently, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are or soon will be undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials in the United States: COVID-19 vaccines do not use the live virus and cannot give you COVID-19. The vaccine does not alter your DNA. COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an immune response without having to experience sickness. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work on the Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. Why should I take the COVID-19 vaccine? Getting this vaccine once it is available to you represents one step that you can take to get the Texas economy, and our day-to-day lives, back to normal. How do I know whether the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? Safety is a top priority while federal partners work to make COVID-19 vaccines available. The new COVID-19 vaccines have been evaluated in tens of thousands of volunteers during clinical trials. The vaccines are only authorized for use if they are found to be safe. Even though they found no safety issues during the clinical trials, CDC and other federal partners will continue to monitor the new vaccines. They watch out for serious side effects (or “adverse events”) using vaccine safety monitoring systems, like the new V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker app. For the most up-to-date information, see the Vaccine Safety section of the CDC website. To learn about CDC’s new vaccine safety monitoring system, see the V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker section of the CDC website.  ▲ Top  Vaccine Availability in Texas Is Texas following CDC’s recommendations for vaccine priorities? If not, why not? While Texas does consider all CDC recommendations, it’s ultimately up to our state’s medical experts to decide vaccine priorities for Texas. DSHS’s Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel (EVAP) provides additional recommendations to the Health Commissioner. The EVAP is taking a medical risk-based approach to identify who is at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19 or at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Who decides how many vaccines Texas gets? CDC determines how many doses of vaccine Texas will receive each week, based on population. Once the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is notified of the number of doses expected the following week, DSHS staff presents possibilities for vaccine distribution to the Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel (EVAP). The panel makes modifications and recommendations to the Commissioner of Health, who makes the final decision on that week’s distribution. Who decides how to distribute the vaccine in Texas? In Texas, DSHS distributes the vaccine with the guidance of the EVAP, appointed by the Health Commissioner, Dr. John Hellerstedt. How did DSHS decide who to immunize first? The Commissioner of Health appointed an EVAP to make recommendations on vaccine allocation decisions. This includes identifying groups that should be vaccinated first. The goal is to provide the most protection to vulnerable populations and critical state resources. EVAP developed Vaccine Allocation Guiding Principles (PDF) that provide the foundation for the Texas vaccine allocation process. Who can get the vaccine now? As of Monday, March 29, 2021, everyone age 16 and older is now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in Texas. The state’s Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel recommended opening vaccination to everyone who falls under the current Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorizations. All vaccines are authorized for people age 18 and older. The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for people 16 and older. If I’m eligible for vaccine now, how do I get one? There are multiple tools to help you find vaccine in Texas. Check these tools frequently, as more providers and pharmacies will be added to each over the coming weeks. Vaccine Locator Tools View an accessible alternative list of Texas vaccination providers (CSV) Large Vaccination Hub List Beginning in January, Texas established large vaccination sites or hubs around the state. Check the COVID‑19 Vaccination Hub Providers page to find a hub near you and learn how to register. Retail Pharmacies List Check your local pharmacy’s website to see if vaccine appointments are available. On March 29, the White House announced that the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program is doubling the number of pharmacies receiving the vaccine by April 19. To find out which pharmacies are participating in the program, visit CDC’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program website. Texas Public Health Vaccine Scheduler The new Texas Vaccine Scheduler helps Texans get scheduled for a COVID-19 vaccine at clinics hosted by participating Texas public health entities. Register online at GetTheVaccine.dshs.texas.gov. You will be notified by email or text when and where to get the vaccine. If there’s not an available clinic near you, you will be directed to other places to get your vaccine. Call (833) 832-7067 if you don’t have internet or need help signing up. Call center support is available 7am-7pm, 7 days a week. Spanish language and other translators are available to help callers. Tips for Your Vaccine Search When searching for a vaccination site, remember: Do you know someone who is eligible for a vaccine but doesn’t have internet access? Please let them know they can call (833) 832-7067 for referral to a local vaccine provider. I am at least 75 years old and can’t leave my house. How can I get a COVID-19 vaccine? Texas launched the COVID-19 “Save Our Seniors Initiative” to identify and vaccinate Texans who are 75+ or are homebound. To register, contact your Local County Judge or Local Office for Emergency Management to let them know you want to sign up. The list of counties changes weekly. Counties currently participating include Aransas, Bowie, Brooks, Calhoun, Cameron, Cass, Coke, Dallas, DeWitt, Duval, Henderson, Hidalgo, Hockley, Hopkins, Karnes, Kinney, Leon, Liberty, Lubbock, Madison, Marion, Matagorda, Mason, Maverick, Orange, Palo Pinto, Rains, Robertson, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, San Patricio, Shelby, Sherman, Sutton, Terry, Titus, Trinity, Upshur, Val Verde, Van Zandt, Waller, Webb, Willacy, Williamson, and Wood.

Governor Abbott Announces Save Our Seniors Initiative to Vaccinate Homebound Seniors in Texas Governor Abbott, TDEM Launch Sixth Week of Save Our Seniors Initiative In 46 Counties Who can provide vaccines, and how does that happen? Any facility, organization or healthcare provider licensed to possess or administer vaccine or provide vaccination services is eligible to enroll as a COVID-19 vaccine provider. Each facility or location, including those that are part of a hospital system or clinic network, must register at EnrollTexasIZ.dshs.texas.gov/emrlogin.asp and complete the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. How can a long-term care facility get residents, staff and providers vaccinated now that the federal partnership sign-up has closed? A long-term care facility that has not already signed up for the federal partnership program has other options to get their residents, staff and providers vaccinated. See Long-Term Care Options for COVID-19 Vaccination (PDF) for additional information. I am hearing that the DSHS Pharmacy Branch has vaccines available. Can I get my vaccine there? No. The DSHS Pharmacy Branch is not a public pharmacy and does not vaccinate people. It receives and distributes medications to providers across the state. Please do not call or visit the DSHS Pharmacy Branch, as they do not vaccinate anyone at this location. What should I do to protect myself and others before I'm fully vaccinated?  Practice the same safety habits you’ve been doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Take the following precautions to limit exposure for yourself and others: List N: Disinfectants for COVID-19.  ▲ Top  Effectiveness Will vaccines prevent people from getting and spreading COVID-19? COVID-19 vaccines are new and are still being evaluated. Some COVID-19 vaccines may prevent severe illness, while others may prevent people from getting COVID-19 altogether. Others may be effective to prevent spreading COVID-19. CDC and DSHS will keep the public informed as they learn more. How effective will the vaccine be against COVID-19, and for how long? Different vaccines are proving to have different efficacy rates. Some manufacturers are reporting 90% to 95% protection at 1–2 weeks after receiving the final dose. At this time, experts do not know how long protection will last or whether a booster shot will be necessary later, after the initial recommended vaccine dose(s). CDC and DSHS will keep the public informed as they learn more. After we get vaccinated, will we still need to wear a mask or cloth face covering and socially distance? Yes. Experts are still learning about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions. The vaccine is not expected to be 100% effective. At this time, CDC recommends that everyone continue to use all the tools to protect ourselves and others from getting and spreading the virus. Wear a mask or cloth face covering whenever you are out in public or when around people who don’t live in your household. These masks or face coverings help when you can’t avoid being in the same space as others. Wearing a mask or cloth face covering does not mean you don’t need to stay a safe distance from others. Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet apart from others, is still necessary to keep you and others safe. How long will I have to wear a mask, stay six feet from others and wash my hands? Experts at CDC are learning about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions. So, once you get vaccinated, keep wearing your mask, washing your hands and staying six feet from others until you hear differently from CDC and DSHS.  ▲ Top  Immunity Will the immunity after getting COVID-19 last longer than the protection provided by the vaccine? We are still learning about how long a recovered person is protected by “natural immunity.” Early evidence suggests that immunity after having COVID-19 may not last very long. We also don’t know yet how long the vaccines’ protection lasts, called “vaccine-induced immunity.” CDC and DSHS will keep the public informed as more information becomes available. Will we ever achieve “herd immunity” in Texas? Experts are still learning about what percentage of Texans would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. This term describes when enough people have protection, either from a previous infection or from vaccination, that it is unlikely a virus or bacteria can spread between people in a community and cause disease. The percentage needed to reach herd immunity varies by disease. CDC and DSHS will keep the public informed as more information becomes available.  ▲ Top  Getting Vaccinated Do I need to get vaccinated if I’ve already recovered from COVID-19? Yes. Immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine may last longer than the natural immunity you get if you’ve already had COVID-19. People who currently have COVID-19 should not be vaccinated while being sick. Will the COVID-19 vaccine be one or two shots? How long after the first dose do I take the second one? All but one of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development need two shots to be effective. You need two doses from the same manufacturer, spaced 21 or 28 days apart. You will get full protection from the vaccine usually 1–2 weeks after getting your second dose. At this time, experts do not know how long protection will last or whether a booster shot will be necessary later, after the initial recommended vaccine dose(s). CDC and DSHS will keep the public informed as they learn more. Can I just take one of the two doses? For all but one of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development, you will need two shots for full protection. You will need two doses from the same manufacturer, spaced 21 or 28 days apart, depending on the vaccine manufacturer. You will get full protection from the vaccine usually 1–2 weeks after getting your second dose. Get the second shot even if you have side effects from the first shot, unless the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider tells you not to get the shot. When you get the vaccine, you will receive information about what kind of vaccine you got and when you need to come back for your second dose. You can register and use the new V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker to receive health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination, as well as reminders to get your second dose if you need one. If you choose to get only one dose, the amount of protection you may have is not known. Do I have to get the second dose from the same location I got the first dose? My provider doesn't know when they'll get another vaccine shipment. No, you do not have to get your second dose from the same location as you got the first dose. Providers should receive second doses for those who received their first dose. However, if you need to locate a second dose, be sure it’s from the same manufacturer and after the recommended dose interval. For more information, refer to the vaccination materials you received from your provider when you received your first dose. Those may include a vaccination fact sheet and/or record card. If I'm unable to get the second dose within the recommended timeframe, do I have to start all over? No, you do not have to start all over. Missing the suggested interval delays full protection. But you can still get the second dose later if you have difficulty getting it within the recommended time. Just don’t get it earlier than recommended. According to CDC, if you need help scheduling your vaccine appointment for your second shot, contact the location that set up your appointment for assistance. Both COVID-19 mRNA vaccines will need two shots to get the most protection. The timing between your first and second shot depends on which vaccine you received. You should get your second shot: You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. For more information, visit the What to Expect after Getting a COVID‑19 Vaccine section of the CDC website. For information about the Pfizer vaccine, visit the Information about the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 Vaccine section of the CDC website. For information about the Moderna vaccine, visit the Information about the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine section of the CDC website. Which vaccine should I get for COVID-19? Do I have a choice? You always have a choice about your health care. Talk to a healthcare provider to get information specific to your situation. Does the vaccine I choose depend on my age or underlying conditions? Different COVID-19 vaccines may be more suitable for certain people. Your age and/or underlying conditions may also affect when you are eligible to get the vaccine. Talk to a healthcare provider to get information specific to you and the COVID-19 vaccine. How long after I get the COVID-19 vaccine before I am protected? For the two-dose vaccines, the process of getting fully vaccinated takes over a month in total. You will get full protection from the vaccine usually 1–2 weeks after getting your second dose.  Talk to a healthcare provider to get information specific to your COVID-19 vaccine. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I have COVID-19? Talk to your healthcare provider about the timing of your vaccination(s) if you have been sick with COVID-19.  What are some side effects from the vaccines for COVID-19? COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a number of side effects, but almost all of them are mild. They include pain and redness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, body aches and even fever.  Having symptoms like fever after you get a vaccine is normal and a sign your immune system is building protection against the virus. The side effects from COVID-19 vaccination may feel like flu, but they should go away in a few days.  If you get the vaccine and experience severe side effects or ones that do not go away in a couple of days, contact your healthcare provider for further instructions on how to take care of yourself. You can register and use the new V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker to receive health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination, as well as reminders to get your second dose if you need one. To learn what side effects to expect and get helpful tips on how to reduce pain and discomfort after your vaccination, visit the What to Expect after Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine section of the CDC website. Does the vaccine react poorly with any medications, or do the prescriptions I'm taking preclude me from being able to get a vaccine? You will need to check with your healthcare provider about whether your medication will interfere with being vaccinated.  ▲ Top  Safety How do I report it if I have a bad reaction to a vaccine? CDC has a new smartphone-based tool for this effort called v-safe. This tool helps CDC check in on people’s health after they receive a COVID-19 vaccine. When you get your vaccine, you should also receive a v-safe information sheet telling you how to enroll in v-safe. If you enroll, you will get regular text messages directing you to surveys. Use these surveys to report any problems or adverse reactions you have after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Read about v-safe with the V-safe Information Sheet (PDF). According to CDC’s website, CDC and FDA encourage the public to report possible side effects (called adverse events) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This national system collects these data to look for adverse events. Those may include ones that are unexpected, ones that appear to happen more often than expected or ones that have unusual patterns of occurrence. Reports to VAERS help CDC monitor the safety of vaccines. Safety is a top priority. For more information about the difference between a vaccine side effect and an adverse event, visit the Understanding Side Effects and Adverse Events section of the CDC website. For more information about the reporting system, visit the VAERS website or call 800-822-7967. You should also let your doctor know about your reaction. According to CDC, healthcare providers will need to report some vaccine side effects to VAERS. Can the COVID-19 vaccine make me sick or give me COVID-19? No. COVID-19 vaccines do not use the live virus and cannot give you COVID-19. The vaccine does not alter your DNA. COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an immune response without having to experience sickness.  To learn about COVID-19 vaccines, visit the Different COVID-19 Vaccines section of the CDC website. Can children get the vaccine, or will they rely on their natural immune system to protect them? At this time, experts do not know how safe the COVID-19 vaccine is for children. People 16 years old and older are currently eligible to get the vaccine if they are in a priority population.  Can pregnant women get the vaccine? At this time, experts do not know how safe the COVID-19 vaccine is for people who are pregnant. Data from studies are limited. But experts believe COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to people who are pregnant. If you are pregnant and are eligible to get the vaccine, you may choose to get vaccinated. Discuss your options and any concerns with your healthcare provider. For more information about COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy, visit the Vaccination Considerations for People who are Pregnant or Breastfeeding section of the CDC website.   ▲ Top  More Information Where can I get reliable information about vaccines for COVID-19?

If as many people as possible get vaccinated and we continue to follow health recommendations, we will win this fight against this virus. Are COVID-19 vaccines safe? Over 63 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through February 21, 2021. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met FDA’s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA). Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines will undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. U of U Health  Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html The COVID-19 Vaccine is Safe and EffectiveDecember 11, 2020 Vaccine distribution counter Population fully vaccinated(based on 2019 population estimates) People who are partially vaccinated People who arefully vaccinated Total vaccines administered *Data updated daily Monday through Friday. 7 facts you need to know about COVID-19 vaccines 7 facts you need to know about  COVID-19 vaccines Fact #1 COVID-19 vaccines don’t give you COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain any part of the virus, so it can’t cause you to get COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines protect you from the virus. You may get side effects after you get vaccinated, like a sore arm or fever. These are normal and common. Fact #2 COVID-19 vaccines are safe, even though they were developed quickly.  No steps were skipped developing COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists around the world have been working on this technology for more than a decade. This is why it was possible to make a safe and effective vaccine available very quickly. Fact #3 COVID-19 vaccines may protect you against more than one strain of the virus. Viruses change, or develop small mutations, over time. Data shows COVID-19 vaccines are effective against the strains we’ve seen so far of the virus that causes COVID-19. Fact #4 COVID-19 vaccines don’t change your DNA. COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines and don’t interact with your DNA in any way. They trigger an immune response that creates antibodies to protect you from getting infected with COVID-19. Fact #5 COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility or miscarriage. COVID-19 hasn’t caused infertility in women who’ve had the virus, so there’s no reason to think the vaccine would cause it. No other vaccine has ever been found to increase any risks for unborn or breastfed babies, or for pregnancies. There was some information spread online that was not true; saying that the protein in the vaccine attacks a protein in the placenta. This is not true. The small number of amino acids in the two proteins would not cause that effect. COVID-19 vaccines haven’t been tested in pregnant women, but pregnant women do get vaccinated for other illnesses during pregnancy. Pregnant women have an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and there is a chance you could give COVID-19 to your baby after he or she is born. Talk to your doctor to see if you should get vaccinated. Fact #6  COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain microchips or tracking devices. Misinformation that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips or tracking devices has been proven false. We know exactly what is in each vaccine. The list of ingredients in each vaccine can be found here. here Fact #7 People with chronic diseases or conditions should get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn to get the vaccine. If you have a chronic disease, like diabetes, you are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for people with chronic diseases or conditions. What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines? It is common for people to have mild or moderate symptoms or side effects after they get a vaccination. There is usually no reason to worry if you get mild to moderate symptoms a few days after getting vaccinated. This means your body has started working to create an immune response and is learning to fight the disease. Mild or moderate symptoms include things like a fever or redness around an injection site.

Vaccines help your body fight off the virus and keep you from getting sick. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we can end the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines are important tools to help slow the spread of COVID-19 The Health Department is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners to distribute vaccines as they become available. Our goal is to administer every available dose each week.  Everyone will be offered a vaccine, but it will take time to get to everyone. COVID-19 vaccines are provided to Vermonters at no cost. getting the vaccine getting the vaccine Sign up for our weekly COVID-19 UPDATE Sign up for our weekly COVID-19 UPDATE Eligibility Learn More Who can get a vaccine now? Who will be eligible next? Details on high-risk health conditions As each group becomes eligible, we will announce when those people can make appointments. In addition to Health Department communications, we work with partners such as health care practices, pharmacies, employers, and local news media to announce additional groups who become eligible for the vaccine. How Decisions are Made The Health Department works with State leadership to make these difficult choices after considering recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, CDC, and Vermont’s Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee. Based on our data, we know that focusing next on providing vaccine to people based on their age and whether they have certain high-risk health conditions will help us save lives. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Vermont’s Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee Equity is also a consideration in our vaccination efforts. We are committed to addressing the historical and current factors that contribute to health disparities. Members of certain demographic groups have been disproportionately overrepresented in Vermont’s COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death rates. Because of these increased risks, historical harms and the resulting mistrust of health care and public health, we will ensure that Black, Indigenous and people of color in Vermont community gets the support they need, in the language they need, in the locations they need, to make informed choices and to get scheduled for vaccinations. As part of our strategy to prioritize Vermonters most at risk of severe illness and save lives, we have also begun vaccinating Vermonters in communities that have unique needs, such as people who speak languages other than English and people who are homebound. This requires us to meet people where they are and find ways to reduce known barriers to vaccine access where we can. We will continue to do this as more vaccine becomes available and we are able to reach more people in Vermont. Below are some examples of ways we are working to meet Vermonters where they are to work toward equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Vermonters who are Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) We still have much more to do to address the significant disparities in the rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death among Vermonters who are Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC). Right now we are working with funded community partners to understand the barriers that might limit vaccine access for BIPOC Vermonters, as these require unique public health solutions. This coordinated vaccination effort is an important step in working with and compensating trusted community partner networks to reach some of the most historically marginalized people in Vermont.  AAPI stands for Asian American and Pacific Islander. APIDA stands for Asian, Pacific Islander, Desi American. Desi is a pan-ethnic term used to refer to people from South Asia. People Who Speak Languages Other Than English The Health Department has begun holding clinics for Vermonters who are eligible by their age grouping — and their family members age 16 and older — who need safe access to linguistically and culturally appropriate services. We work with cultural liaisons, have interpreters on hand or easily accessible, and provide accurately translated materials for these Vermonters.  We understand that language barriers and other factors faced by immigrant and refugee communities have led to outbreaks, disproportionate outcomes, and a markedly greater risk of COVID-19. It makes good public health sense to allow families and households facing language and access barriers to get information and services at the same time, rather than duplicate these services later on.  Migrant farm worker vaccination initiative   To ensure equitable access to vaccine for migrant farm workers, we are working closely with our local health offices across the state, along with partners Bridges to Health and the Open Door Clinic, who have established connections to migrant agricultural communities. Little Rivers Health Care is supporting these efforts in the Upper Valley region of Vermont. The initiative has started in Addison County, with plans in place to expand across Vermont. These small, on-site vaccinations are being customized to meet the needs of different farms that are home to congregate living spaces. They are for farm workers who meet the current eligibility criteria, along with fellow farm workers living in the same household.  Bridges to Health Open Door Clinic Little Rivers Health Care People Who Are Homebound The Health Department is coordinating vaccination for people who are homebound through a partnership between local home health and EMS agencies. This includes people who are eligible by their age grouping and are both homebound and in the service of local home health agencies (including both VNA agencies and Bayada). We know that there are homebound community members who do not receive home health services who will need to be vaccinated. Once the group of homebound people who are connected to home health agencies are vaccinated, we will expand this service by reaching out through numerous partners, including primary care, Agencies on Aging, and municipalities to identify people to include in the second phase of outreach. About the Vaccines Three COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received an EUA on December 11, 2020. The Moderna vaccine received an EUA on December 18, 2020.  The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Biotech, Inc.) vaccine received an EUA on February 27, 2021. An EUA is a way for vaccines and other medicines to be approved in a public health emergency. After proving the vaccines are safe and effective, they can be used while long term studies continue. Learn more about Emergency Use Authorization and watch a video on what an EUA is. Emergency Use Authorization video Which vaccine will I get? About vaccine efficacy All three vaccines are safe and similarly effective at preventing severe illness and death. This standard is what is most commonly used to assess other vaccines like the flu shot. We cannot directly compare the efficacy of the three vaccines because they were not studied against each other at the same time. Each clinical trial had different study protocols, timing and location. For example, variants weren’t widely circulating when the earlier vaccines were being tested. Virus Variants Viruses constantly change through mutation. New variants and strains are expected. Many emerge and disappear, but others can persist and even become the most common strain. Some variants are more concerning than others. The less a virus spreads, the fewer chances for it to mutate into different variants. This is why prevention steps, including vaccines, are so important. Right now there are a few different variants of concern. Some variants spread more easily from one person to another. So far, studies suggest that the vaccines available now will help our bodies fight against strains of the virus that causes COVID-19. This is being closely investigated and more studies are happening now. The best way to protect yourself against the virus and variants is to get the vaccine when it’s available to you. Learn more about variants Learn more about variants About the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine How It WorksmRNA vaccines are introduced into the body to tell the body to make a harmless piece of “spike protein.” Your immune system sees the spike protein doesn’t belong in your body and starts building an immune response. This means that the next time you come in contact with the virus that causes COVID-19, your body knows how to fight it off.

Have questions About the Johnson & Johnson Vaccine How It WorksVector vaccines use a modified virus like a cold virus that can’t make copies of itself or infect you. The vector virus tells your body to make harmless pieces of “spike proteins.” Your immune system sees the spike protein doesn’t belong in your body and starts building an immune response. This means that the next time you come in contact with the COVID-19 virus your body knows how to fight it off. Scientists have been researching this type of vaccine for decades.

Have questions Years of research into vaccines have brought us to where we are today. Scientists began researching coronavirus vaccines starting with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. When these viruses disappeared, the pressure to find a coronavirus vaccine decreased. When COVID-19 was identified, the global focus on eliminating this new coronavirus and ending the pandemic, combined with large amounts of funding, helped speed up the research process to create a safe and effective vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine received Emergency Use Authorization from U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Moderna vaccine Johnson & Johnson Step 1: Vaccine Safety With a brand new vaccine, researchers give it to a small number of volunteers — usually 20 to 100 — to test for any serious side effects. This step also helps determine the right dose or amount of vaccine to use. Step 2: Vaccine Effectiveness Once they know a vaccine isn’t likely to cause any serious side effects, researchers then give it to hundreds of people to determine how well the vaccine works (or its effectiveness). Researchers continue to monitor for any short-term side effects. Step 3: Double Check Safety & Effectiveness This is the last step before researchers can apply for approval from the FDA and begin to use it. To make sure the vaccine is safe and effective for people across ages, ethnicities, genders, and other factors, they give it to tens of thousands of people. This uncovers less common side effects and confirms once again that it’s safe and works well for everyone. Step 4: Continue to Check Safety & Effectiveness: Even after researchers have answered the big questions, they keep studying the vaccine. They gather longer-term data to make sure the vaccine continues to work well. Sometimes, when a vaccine is urgently needed, researchers combine steps to speed up the approval process. This doesn’t mean that they’re skipping any important steps. It does mean researchers and public health organizations are working together at an extraordinary level to get a safe, e­ffective vaccine to the people who need it the most. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, spaced about 3-4 weeks apart. We strongly recommend Vermonters get both doses for the highest level of protection from COVID-19. Two doses of these vaccines are scientifically proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19.  Since the beginning, we have followed the science. Participants in the clinical trials who did not receive both doses were not followed for a long period of time, so we do not know for sure about how well or how long one dose will protect you. Two doses of these vaccines are scientifically proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19.  A two-dose vaccine is not new. For some vaccines, like hepatitis B, shingles and HPV, two doses produce a longer-lasting protection. While the first dose gets your immune system ready and offers some protection, the second dose boosts that protection by using your body’s new immune cells it created after the first dose. This “booster” increases the strength of your new antibody protection and makes it last longer. Taking the full course of vaccine offers better protection against variants of the virus. In fact, being only partially vaccinated, for example getting only one dose of a two-dose vaccine, could increase the risk of vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This is because the virus could be weakened with some antibody protection, but not stopped completely, creating the potential for the virus to mutate. Some people experience stronger side effects after the second shot. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have equal doses in their first and second shots, but for some, stronger side effects are part of their body’s normal immune reaction to that “boost” in protection. Common side effects reported were pain at the injection site, fever, chills, tiredness and headache. These side effects typically go away within a few days. Whether you experience side effects or not, rest assured the vaccine is working to protect you, your family and your community. Yes. People who get the vaccine should continue taking steps to prevent COVID-19. You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is two weeks after your final shot. It takes time for the vaccine to train your body to fight COVID-19. While the vaccine protects you from serious illness, we don’t know if you can give the virus to someone else. Until enough people are vaccinated and we know more, we need to follow the safety guidelines like wearing a mask out in public, washing your hands frequently, and social distancing and following social gathering guidelines. steps to prevent COVID-19 washing your hands social distancing social gathering If you are fully vaccinated and then are a close contact of someone with COVID-19, you do not need to quarantine in certain situations. Learn more about what this means. Learn more about what this means If you are fully vaccinated you do not have to quarantine when you travel or return to Vermont.  Together, the vaccine and preventive actions are the best ways to keep from getting and spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19  COVID-19: Vaccine Safety and Efficacy  A vaccinated person has a far lower risk of getting severely sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19, no matter which vaccine they get. Available COVID-19 vaccines There are currently three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States: the Pfizer vaccine. the Moderna vaccine, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Other COVID-19 vaccines are in development. You can find the other COVID-19 vaccines that are in clinical trial phases II or III through the COVID-19 vaccine tracker. All the available vaccines are very safe and great at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccine tracker Pfizer Authorized for individuals age 16 years and older. Type: mRNA mRNA Dose: 2 doses 21 days apart Efficacy: Decreased risk of moderate to severe COVID-19 disease by 95%. Reduced the risk of hospitalization by 100%. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Moderna Authorized for individuals age 18 years and older. Type: mRNA mRNA Dose: 2 doses 28 days apart Efficacy: Decreased risk of moderate to severe COVID-19 disease by 94.1% efficacy. Reduced the risk of hospitalization by 89% Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Authorized for individuals age 18 years older. Type: viral vector viral vector Dose: 1 Dose (it takes 28 days after vaccination for your body to build immunity) Efficacy: Decreased risk of moderate to severe COVID-19 disease by 72% in the US and 64% in South Africa, where a highly contagious variant is causing the most cases. The vaccine also reduced risk of severe disease by 86% across all regions studied and reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 100%. Source: early data released by Johnson & Johnson early data released by Johnson & Johnson Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness In clinical trials, researchers measure how well a vaccine prevents illness in a controlled setting. This is called efficacy. The efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials are impressive, showing the vaccine works at preventing symptomatic infection (feeling sick and testing positive for COVID-19). After the FDA approves a vaccine, it continues to be studied to determine how well it works in the real world, outside of clinical trials. This is called effectiveness. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is continually studied as the vaccine is rolled out. Different types of vaccines All vaccines help enhance our body’s own immune systems, so that when we are exposed to a virus, our immune systems are ready to fight it and can keep us healthy. mRNA vaccines give our cells instructions on how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. Our immune response produces antibodies that protect us from getting infected. mRNA vaccines do not put virus into our bodies and cannot give someone COVID19. Our cells break down and get rid of the mRNA as soon as it is finished using the instructions. The vaccine does not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. Pfizer Moderna Viral vector vaccines use a safe, modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. For COVID-19 viral vector vaccines, the vector will enter a cell in our body and will make a harmless piece of the virus (like the spike protein), so our immune system can learn how to fight it. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect us against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Oxford/AstraZeneca (not available in the United States) Protein-based vaccines show the body a protein from the virus (like the COVID-19 spike protein), so our immune systems learn to recognize and fight it. Learn more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines from the CDC. different types of COVID-19 vaccines Novavax (not available in the US) Sanofi (not available in the US) Developing COVID-19 vaccines Developing new vaccines is a thorough and careful process. Safety is the top priority during all phases of vaccine development, approval, and use. Safety  Before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can approve a vaccine, it has to be tested through clinical trials to make sure it is safe and see how well it prevents illness. The participants of the trials included people of different ages, races, and ethnicity, as well as those with different medical conditions to make sure it works across the board. The participants of the trials included people of different ages, races, and ethnicity, as well as those with different medical conditions to make sure it works across the board. Researchers enrolled far more clinical trial participants than is usually required, so they could notice and address safety concerns more easily and quickly. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers of Disease Control (CDC), and independent advisors review all vaccine safety and efficacy data before any vaccine is authorized for use. CDC and FDA continue to monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness after they are approved or authorized. Medical experts are still learning whether COVID-19 vaccines are safe for children and pregnant people and how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others, even if you do not get sick. Learn more about medical experts ensure vaccines work both in clinical trials and the real world by visiting the CDC’s website. CDC’s website During a public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA can authorize safe and effective medical devices, treatments and vaccines more quickly using Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). EUAs help the necessary medical products get authorized more quickly while still being based on the best available science. COVID-19 vaccines are going through all the same steps in the trial phases that all vaccines go through. The EUA program has existed since 2004 and has helped public health officials and physicians use new products to detect, prevent, or treat a disease during emergencies. For example, the FDA issued EUAs for respirators, medications, and tests during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, 2014 Ebola epidemic, and now in the COVID-19 pandemic. EUAs end when the Secretary of Health and Human Services decides the emergency has ended, or if the medical product receives typical approved. Vaccines authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) can be used in the public, but might not have fully completed their phase 3 trials. EUAs end when the emergency has ended, or if the medical product is fully approved or licensed. A COVID-19 vaccine can still get a Biologics License (full FDA approval) after is has gotten an EUA. The FDA and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will review the data again to approve and recommend the vaccine.   Learn more about EUAs by visiting FDA's website. FDA's website There are systems in place that track common side effects and rare adverse (or serious) reactions in people who receive any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. CDC and FDA monitor these systems in real time to make sure safety issues are detected as quickly as possible. V-safe is a new smartphone-based tool that makes it easy for people to report any health problems or serious reactions after they get their COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe Learn more about v-safe by visiting the CDC’s website. CDC’s website Frequently asked questions See answers to frequently asked questions about COVID-19 vaccines, safety, and efficacy by opening the tabs below. Vaccine approval is driven by science. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers of Disease Control (CDC,) and independent advisors review all vaccine safety and efficacy data before any vaccine is approved and allowed to be used. COVID-19 vaccines are going through the same steps in the trial phases that all vaccines go through to get the full FDA vaccine license and approval. During emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) to let people get a vaccine before all the trials are complete. The FDA will only give a COVID-19 vaccine an EUA if the current phase III trial data shows the vaccine is safe. Like with all vaccines, after a COVID-19 vaccine is made available to the public, the FDA and CDC will continue to closely monitor the vaccine to help ensure any issues are immediately addressed. COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials to make sure they meet safety standards. Visit CDC’s website for more information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines   COVID-19 Vaccine, P-02945English   English Available COVID-19 Vaccines, P-02946English   English There are a number of systems in place to monitor reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the national system that collects reports from healthcare professionals, vaccine manufacturers, and the public on adverse events that happen after vaccination. Reports of adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected, or have unusual patterns are followed up with specific studies. Providers are required to report any adverse events to this system. V-safe, a smartphone-based after vaccination health checker program through the CDC, uses text messages and web surveys to check in with people who received a COVID-19 vaccine for the first 14 days after getting vaccinated. Text messages are also sent as reminders to receive the second vaccine dose if you received a vaccine that is part of a 2-dose series (such as Pfizer or Moderna). a smartphone-based after vaccination health checker program Vaccine Safety Data Link is a network of nine integrated health care organizations across the United States that conduct active surveillance and research. The system is also used to help determine whether possible side effects identified through VAERS are actually related to vaccination. Note: Vaccinators are instructed to monitor people for a short time (around 15-30 minutes) after getting vaccinated to quickly address any immediate reactions. CDC and the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have provided information to assist pregnant people with their decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Learn more on CDC’s website. CDC’s website No safety steps were skipped during the development of COVID-19 vaccines. A number of factors allowed safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to be available quickly. Earlier research on other coronaviruses (like SARS and MERS) jump started the COVID-19 vaccine development process. SARS was first detected in 2002, while MERS was first detected in 2012, and both have been researched ever since. Through ground-breaking partnerships between leading medical experts, scientists were able to build on lessons learned from past pandemics (Zika, Ebola, H1N1) to make the COVID-19 vaccines. Medical experts and other key players all dedicated their time, effort, and resources to developing a COVID-19 vaccines. Issuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) shortened the official process, but did not skip any safety steps. For example, the FDA invited more experts to review than usual. With all hands on deck, the review process was shortened from months to weeks. The EUA allowed faster public access to vaccines.   COVID-19 Vaccine Safety, P-02872English | Chinese | Hindi | Hmong | Somali | Spanish  English Chinese Hindi Hmong Somali Spanish Available COVID-19 Vaccines, P-02946English   English Clinical trial data show all authorized COVID-19 vaccines are very good at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. COVID-19 vaccines continue to be studied to determine how well they work in the real world, outside of clinical trials. The CDC will be sharing more of this data soon.  Vaccines work by triggering our immune system to recognize certain bacteria or viruses and build immunity to defend against them if they return. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain mRNA that instruct our body to make the coronavirus spike protein, which is harmless on its own. The spike protein is the same protein that is found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. By copying the spike protein, our immune system is able to produce specific antibodies that can defend against SARS-CoV-2. This helps protect us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies because our immune system can now recognize the spike protein to defend itself from infection. You can learn more about how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work on CDC’s website. CDC’s website No. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are made with mRNA technology. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, which means that it contains just a part of the virus that causes COVID-19 inserted into the backbone of an adenovirus vector. This vector poses no threat of causing illness in humans. Both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine contain the following ingredients: mRNA (also known as messenger ribonucleic acid) Lipids Salts Sugar They do NOT contain fetal cells, blood products, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, mercury, egg, latex, pork products, preservatives, or microchips. See full lists of ingredients for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Pfizer Moderna Yes. People with underlying conditions can get the COVID-19 vaccine as long as they are not allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccines .When checking, it is important to look at the detailed list linked above. Vaccination is important for people with underlying medical conditions because they may be at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Visit CDC’s website about vaccine considerations for people with underlying medical conditions to make an informed decision. CDC’s website Adverse reactions are possible, although they are very rare. Systems, like VAERS and v-safe, are in place to monitor for reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. This is why you may be asked to wait 15 minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine so any reactions can immediately be addressed. Based on initial evidence all three authorized vaccines effectively reduce the risk of COVID-19 for all of the circulating variants.
