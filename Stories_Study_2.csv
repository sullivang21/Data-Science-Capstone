1,"Sinking into the plush armchair, she felt herself slipping into her daydream again. Robin had always been a daydreamer, falling so deeply into detailed worlds that she saw so vividly.
Feeling the caresses of the breeze on her skin, Robin opened her eyes, stunned. Her meandering thoughts about the deep pine forest outside her grandparent’s house seemed to have led her into something like a dream. Towering pines stood around her, allowing beams of light to shine through their branches and illuminate the path below. Mossy emerald boulders dotted the path she was on, bearing shelter to ferns and delicate lacy white wildflowers at their bases.
Entranced, she started along the path, smelling the musk of the forest and stepping over fallen logs now home to woodland creatures. She could hear the chittering of red squirrels and calls of magpies in the branches above, reminded of the sounds of her childhood summers in this very forest.
As she explored the path leading her under the canopy, she came across a small brook running across the path. Coming up to the brook, she stepped over the plank of wood meant to provide passage over the running water. As she stepped over the wood, her toe of her boot caught the head of a nail. Thrown off her balance, Robin stumbled from the makeshift bridge and one of her feet stepped into the shallow stream into the chilly mountain water.
Feeling a desire to return home to the comfort of dry shoes, Robin snapped back from her daydream and found herself back nestled into the armchair by the window, recognizing once again her home. 
Puzzled, she looked down at her feet. One boot was damp and her wool sock inside was completely soaked.
Confused, she looked down incredulously. Had she transported herself to another place?"
2,"Alice was walking to the bank one day when suddenly she imagined herself being hit by a car on her usual route over.  She knew it was silly to let her imagination get the best of her but she decided to go the other way just to make herself feel better.  When she arrived at the bank she saw people crowded around the other side of the street.  When she asked a man what had happened he explained that a car had spun out of control and swerved onto the sidewalk.  She couldn’t believe what she was hearing.  Shaken up from the whole ordeal she decided to walk back home to calm herself down.  On her way home however she had another vision.  This time she saw her mom at her house surprising her with some news about her sister.  She shook her head and brushed it off as her mind playing tricks on her, but as she walked up the steps to her house she saw her mother’s car parked outside.  Once her mother saw Alice was home she ran up to her exclaiming that she had some news for her about her sister.  Her sister had just gotten engaged and wanted Alice to be her maid of honor.  Alice felt her head reel and told her mom she needed to go inside and lie down for a bit.  Worried, her mother followed her inside and asked if she was feeling alright.  She asked her mother what the odds are of imagining a scenario in your head and having it become reality only minutes later.  Alice’s mother seemed confused by the sudden question but said she supposed it is possible but that it would be a very unusual coincidence.  She looked very puzzled and asked Alice why she was considering something so unlikely.  Alice just let out a shaky laugh and replied that she was just curious was all.  That seemed to satisfy her mother who immediately began to go off about wedding arrangements for her sister.  Alice found herself zoning out as her mother went on and on.  She thought the only reasonable explanation for what had just happened was that it was a coincidence however she began to have another vision.  She saw her mother dropping a glass from the kitchen and cutting her hand.  Sure enough a few minutes later as her mother went to the kitchen to get a glass of water she dropped one of the glasses and cut herself as she tried to pick up the broken pieces.  As Alice heard the glass shatter on the floor it was like something clicked in her brain.  Her visions were coming true far too often which could only leave her with one conclusion.  She realized she was able to predict the immediate future.  "
3,"Chloe went to bed that night with a terrible migraine. It was as if an unyielding metal ring was being cranked tighter and tighter around her skull until her brain screamed with pain that went up, down, sideways but never out. Just when she was about to give up on sleep, there was a sudden very quiet click; her tortured mind became a blank and she plummeted into oblivion.
Crash. Eyes popped wide open, Chloe found herself staring at the ceiling in her dorm room. 
-“Omg, are you okay??” her roommate stares at her from under drooping eyelids. “What kind of idiot falls off their bed?.. Ughhh only two more hours before my stupid bio midterm…”
 Chloe shakes her head in confusion. “Whaaa? Yeah, I’m fine…Sorry about waking you up, Tess.”
Her response is a loud unceremonious snore.
Wow, that was weird as hell, Chloe thinks. She takes a long, cold shower and throws on her don’t-give-a-damn clothes, grabbing her skateboard and booking it out the door ten minutes before her math 34A midterm. 
Walking through the halls of the dorm she feels a strange tingling sensation in her brain, as if a swarm of subtle whispers are bombarding her thoughts. She is so distracted trying to distinguish them all that it is only when she is halfway to her class that she realizes that she forgot her calculator. 
This is going to be a great way to end the week…She thinks helplessly as she tries not to make eye contact with a girl walking in her direction. I can’t believe he refused to give me a ride to school today, what a prick. I’m so done. Chloe runs past her like a hurricane and into the lecture hall that is already brimming with students. She throws her scantron on the table and desperately bubbles in her name, feeling like she might just go insane. 
“The midterm has now begun” the professor announces. Everything goes silent, including Chloe’s mind.
And then all the answers start flooding in."

~Written for Miss G, because storytime is your favorite time of day. Stay 5 years old forever, little one.~
2.2.16
Once upon a time there stood a little cottage on a little lake. In that little cottage on the little lake, was a little girl named Gabrielle. She loved singing and dancing and playing make believe, and had just started learning how to swim. She’d go out with her mom and sister and wade into the lake until her belly touched the water, and practice kicking and arm strokes mid-air. She never dared go in further, for fear of going underwater. She wasn’t allowed on the dock without an older family member watching over her to make sure she didn’t fall off. After waking up early from her nap one day though, Gabrielle climbed on the dock and stared into the lake. A storm was coming, and she could hear the wind howling and creating riffed waves in the lake. Suddenly, lightening struck the dock. The wooden planks immediately cracked, and Gabrielle fell through the hole in the dock. She tried to keep afloat, but something was pulling her down. Down, down she went into the cold dark waters. Gabrielle was frightened, but she opened her eyes to try and find something to hold on to. Instead, she found something unexpected; she saw she was underwater with colorful fish, sea turtles, and mermaids. Suddenly, she didn’t feel so afraid. She danced with the mermaids and played hide and seek with the jellyfish, until suddenly, she realized that she had been under water for quite some time. As she tried to swim up for air, one of the mermaids told her that she had a special power that allowed her to breathe underwater. Gabrielle couldn’t be any more excited- how fun swim lessons were going to be from now on! After playing with her new friends for a few more minutes, Gabrielle swam to the shore and ran inside. Her little face was beaming as she told her family about her newfound power, and from that day on, Gabrielle was never afraid to go under water again.
The End"
5,"I hadn’t realized before that this was all it took. In my new disguise I can walk down any street at any time. I can get on any bus and look whichever way. I can wear whichever clothes to any place, I can drive into the night and back. Any call I hear I can attend, where I used to have to play deaf and avoid their eyes. 
I looked back over my shoulder, still walking towards my train. The group of men had walked past me and continued oblivious. Not oblivious; I wasn’t invisible. They’d seen me. But they’d seen another Man."
6,"It was late at night when my best friend, Caroline, and I left the movie theater on Friday night. We were walking towards her car laughing hysterically about our favorite scenes in the movie we’d just watched. We were almost to her car and when we heard this super loud noise, like an explosion, coming from right behind us. We automatically fell to the ground and covered our ears. I don’t remember how long it took us to get up, but when I came too I heard Caroline calling out for me. As I was searching for her I caught a glimpse of a people walking towards from the middle of the parking lot and I automatically knew we were in danger. I looked for Caroline frantically and saw she was leaning against someone else’s car. There was blood streaming down her forehead and I knew there was no way we could both get away. I ran to her and told her to run as far and as fast as she could. She tried to protest but I told her I would meet her in the plaza to get help. I told her splitting up was our best chance at surviving. I lied. She would survive, but the only way for that to happen was for me to distract the men coming after us. I had no idea what I was going to do but I as soon I Caroline started running a walked towards the two men coming for us. There was only one thought keeping me going and it was that I could not let anything bad happen to all the innocent people around and especially not to my best friend. All I wanted with every bone in my body was for these men to disappear and leave us all alone. One raised his gun up to me and as he was about to pull the trigger a burst of panic and anger blew out of me and the men that were right in front of me a second ago were just gone. And not just them but the whole middle part of the parking lot was missing. I kept looking around trying to figure out what was happening when I looked down at my hands and saw sparkling smoke like substance coming out of them. I couldn’t understand what was going on. The people who were around me seemed more afraid of me than they ever would have been of the men that had just vanished. But there was no way I could have done that. I was normal, I was only 19 years old, and I couldn’t just wake up one day and have powers. But as it turned out, I did. And that night was the start of the end of my life as I had known it. "
7,"It was completely silent. I opened my eyes. The world looked like a picture. There was a bird stuck in mid-flap, and I saw a squirrel frozen in the process of running up a nearby pine. The intense wind had stopped, and the swaying angle of the leaves made the trees look like dancers. It was like a movie still, all the action caught up in one moment, a unique moment that never happened before and never would happen again. But I could make it last forever.
I could, couldn’t I? If a moment was perfect enough, if I really wanted to, I could make everything stop so that moment could always be, so I could always live in it. But I wouldn’t really be living in it. I would be living in a dead world. The trees were dancing, the sun was shining, but the birds weren’t singing. The perfect moment was gone, it wasn’t a movie scene anymore, it was an exhibit in a museum, after hours, dead and empty, and so quiet the silence is oppressive, forcing its way into my ears, demanding that I listen to it.
I closed my eyes, willing the silence to go away. And sound returned to the world. By the time I opened my eyes the birds had flown away, and the squirrel had climbed his tree, but in the distance I saw another squirrel, and I even glimpsed a fawn through the underbrush. Birds were singing, the wind was howling through the branches, and I heard my class farther along the trail, people talking over the crunching of dead leaves beneath their feet.
I’d always wanted to be special, to have a superpower. Now that I finally had one, I knew I would never use it. Except maybe when I have a test to study for. "
8,"It seemed as if no one understood Anna. People would yell at her for not listening or force her to do things she didn’t understand. She knew she was different, not only because she was treated as if, but because she had been deliberately labeled different since birth. Autistic, some people called it, but to herself she was simply misunderstood. She didn’t necessarily like people, in fact she didn’t like anything much she had around, but there was something about the ocean she liked that no one else could comprehend. She loved the smell of the sea salt, the sand beneath her feet, and the sound of rhythmic waves crashing. She wished to bathe in the water all day. To swim as far as she could and dive deep enough to forget about the world that worked against her. Her parents worried she might drown because they believed she was mentally incapable of swimming on her own, but little did they know about the numerous amount of times she would sneak out of her bedroom at night and dive into the cold dark waters to swim and swim and swim until she touched the ocean bottom. That’s when she felt safe. Away from people. Away from the world she didn’t belong in. She was indeed different! She could breathe underwater. She could speak to the dolphins, stingrays, and clown fish. She made jokes with the underwater animals about how humans knew nothing about the ocean. She raced against whales and played alongside catfish. She felt complete underwater. Everything was right until the sunset broke, when she was forced to swim back to shore and return to her bedroom back on earth. She despised going back but she needed to rest from a long night of swimming. So every morning she would crawl back under the covers and wait for her mother to come get her. She felt happiness and sadness all at once. Happy that she had something no one but herself could enjoy, yet sadness that she was trapped in a world in which she didn’t belong. Anna wasn’t autistic; Anna was meant to live in the ocean."
9,"It wasn’t much anything special.
Catherine loved to talk to her pets all the time. She did it every day. In the morning, “Good morning, Pocky!” In the afternoon, “What’s up, Splinter?” And in the evening, “Goodnight, Ralphie.”
Every day she would say these things to her dog, her rat, and her cat. One day, they simply started answering her back.
In the morning, “’Morning, Kate! How ‘re ya doing? Oh, off to school already? I’ll wait for you!” In the afternoon, “Oh, good day to you too, Cathy.” And in the evening, “Don’t stop petting me now, Catherine, I was just getting comfortable! Typical human.”
And at first, 10-year-old Catherine didn’t think anything of it. She had been talking to her animals for years, why should it be strange that they talked back. It was about time to anyway!
Then one day, a boy at school caught her speaking to a frog. “Ew, Katie, why are you talking to that?”
“Well, I was just telling him about my day.”
“That’s weird. You should stop talking to animals, it’s not like they can say anything back.” He stormed off, leaving Catherine behind to contemplate her situation.
Nobody else can talk to them, she thought. Who would have known! It’s just as well-people wouldn’t appreciate what animals have to say anyway. But I will. I’ll listen to them.
“Are you feeling ok, Katie? That boy didn’t upset you, did he?”
“No, of course not, Mr. Frog. I just realized that I might be the only one who really cares about you.”
“That’s not true, Katie, but you are special. What are you going to do now?”
“I don’t really know…”
It was then that Catherine realized that she really didn’t know what to do with herself and her newfound uniqueness. She went about her days, months, and years, idly using her powers as a part of natural communication, albeit more secretive than most. And when the time came for her to choose her major in college, which would ultimately determine her path in life, Catherine paused.
“What’s the matter, Katie?” her mother asked.
“Nothing, I’m just unsure about which major I want to apply as.”
“Well, you like animals, why not veterinary science?”
“Anything but that…”
And at this point Catherine made an even more important realization. Even with this special power, there was nothing life-changing about her. She was normal, yet unique in her own sense. Her abilities were not the only thing that dictated what she should do; it was also decided by what she wanted to do.
“I think I’ll go into political science, mom. I’m really interested in that kind of stuff.”
“That’s true, honey. Do whatever makes you happiest.”"
10,"This fictional character’s name is Tom, one day Tom was walking down the street and window shopping. He saw this collection of high end cheese through the window of the dairy store and got extremely excited, because it was noon time and he was hungry. But all of a sudden, Tom realized his surrounding had changed, he was no longer on the sidewalk of the Main Street in downtown. He found himself in the middle of a ranch with Alps Mountain in the background. He was confused then realized that he was in Switzerland, Europe. But then he was also wondering how he got there in just a blinking of the eye. He thought that he must have obtained some sort of superpower that enabled him to physically travel to wherever the location he put him minds on. He was panicking at the moment because it was cold in the mountain range and he was only wearing short sleeves, gym shorts, and floppers. Now he had to concentrate his mind to home, downtown Austin so he could go back using his superpower. He also realized that now with this superpower, he must be careful with his thoughts so that he would be hopping around different parts of the world while doing something important. But also he doesn’t have to use any means of transportations to travel or commute. He needed to practice with his thoughts so that he would get an idea on how hard he had to think in order to get to places. So far, Tom was happy with his superpower because he was able to think about his home and got back to his house within 1 millisecond. He needed to practice with his thoughts a bit more and share with his families and friends that he has the superpower of getting to different places around the world with just thinking of them on his mind. He’s not thinking of space just yet because it could be dangerous."
11,"There was a man named Samuel who was walking home from a bar one night and somehow managed to get himself into a bar fight. He did not drink. Sam simply goes to bars to people watch. Sam enjoyed watching guys get plastered off their asses and attempt to bring girls home with them. It was not until one night, when he was watching an extremely trashed man hitting on a tiny little girl who was probably in the bar with a fake ID. This tall man spotted Sam staring at them so he went over there. 
“What the hell are you doing staring at us? What’s your problem, man?” slurred the man.
Sam smirked and turned the other way to leave. He clearly did not want any part of this. But the man pressed on. He kept trying to get Sam’s attention but Sam would not give it to him. This man got fed up and slammed a glass beer bottle on the side of the table so that he could have the sharp part aimed at Sam. 
“Okay let’s take it easy here, I was not intentionally staring at you” Sam said panicked. 
With the broken glass just millimeters from his face, this man slit a tiny little X mark right above his left temple. 
“Mind your own business from now on” the man said in the shadiest voice ever with a malicious smirk on his face. 
Sam ran home after that incident not because he was scared, but because he had a throbbing headache. The worst headache any one could possibly have. Sam figured he would just sleep it off before going to the doctors. It was probably the crazy bar fight that had Sam’s head spinning. 
When Sam woke up in the morning, everything felt eerily calm. Everything just seemed too normal. But he was not going to be the one to question normal. If his headache was gone, Sam could just go back to people watching. Maybe not back at the bar though, he’d probably just go to the local park. 
As Sam made his way over to the closest park by his house, his head started throbbing again. It was as if every time Sam started staring at someone for more than 20 seconds, a rush of thoughts would infiltrate his head. But when Sam looked away at an inanimate object, his migraine would suddenly disappear. 
It seemed as if Sam had the power to read people’s minds. ‘Is this what the guy meant the other night? Is this why he slit an X right above my temple?’ Sam thought. That is when Sam realized that he now has the power to read people’s minds. If only he knew how to control it…"
12,"What if one day you woke up and discovered that you could snap your fingers and the meal you were thinking of would appear just like that! Amanda discovered this one morning when she was joking with her sister that she wished they had an amazing brunch and jokingly snapped her fingers and boom the famous brunch she was picturing appeared. She thought this was great and even better was that when they finished eating it would just disappear and there would be no dishes or food to clean up. The moment she realized that her power was even more amazing then she originally thought it was, getting food whenever she wanted, occurred on a Friday afternoon. Right after they were done eating dinner on Friday and the food disappeared along with the dishes, Amanda went for a night stroll with her sister and found that the food they had not finished and disappeared traveled to a person in need. Tonight the person in need was a homeless man outside their apartment. She was shocked to see the exact meal that she had eaten was also what the homeless man was eating. Not only was she surprised, but the homeless man seemed very happy with this unexpected meal from who knows where. She realized that her power was not selfish, but instead that it could help people in need. Instead of just snapping her fingers when she was hungry, she could snap them a little more often and send the food to someone in need. She realized that all the years of her parents telling her to finish her dinner because other kids are starving in the world would not be a thing anymore and the food she did not need herself could be sent to those families in need. While Amanda could not turn invisible or fly, like she always thought powers were, she was very satisfied and proud of her power because besides getting what she wanted, she was able to help a greater society. Instead of Superman saving the world, she was giving people a basic need of survival, and with that she was satisfied. Amanda realized an important aspect of powers: a power is greater if it helps not only you, but the people surrounding you and all over the world.  "
13,"I’ve been on this road for a while now. I think I missed my exit. I look down at how much gas I’ve used. I definitely missed my exit. I stop to get gas and I’m on the road again. As I merge onto the highway one more time, I realize there’s no one on the road but me. “Where am I?” I thought. This isn’t remotely close to where I’m supposed to be going. “What’s Bellevue?” I ask myself. I pass another sign. “Washington?! How the hell did I end up here?” I see a light. Someone’s definitely got their brights on. They’re coming head on. Five seconds later everything is black. I can’t see anything. Am I dead?
I woke up in a hospital. I was familiar with this hospital. I knew where I was. A doctor walks by… “Excuse me!! How did I get here? I was in Washington last time I checked.” The doctor, one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, comes into my room and tells me that I was in a car accident not even five miles down the road. “That’s impossible,” I thought. I cannot remember anything that has happened to me. I don’t even remember being in this city. “That’s impossible,” I tell the doctor, “I haven’t been in Greenville in two years.” She looks at me and says, “You can leave all you want but you will always come home.” Then disappears into thin air. I never saw that woman again. 
I slept for three whole days after that. I woke up in the whitest room I’ve ever seen. A man walks by. It was my brother. My brother has been dead for five years. He passed away while at college in Washington. No one knows how…or why. 
“I’m not in Greenville, am I, Todd?” I asked. He looks at me and smiles. He doesn’t say a word. He holds out his hand and I follow him. The white room never ends. It just keeps on going and going. Everyone is beautiful. I feel more alive than I ever have.
Sometimes I visit my parents when they’re praying for Todd and I. They don’t get sad anymore and I am proud of them for that. I’m never leaving home ever again. "
14,"6:20 am
She woke up frowning. The light from the early morning sunset pierced her eyes, a flaming reminder of how yesterday’s discovery had thrown her entire schedule off, even her ritual of closing the blind to ward off the blinding sun.
6:27 am
She would not be falling back asleep. Stepping gingerly onto the cold linoleum floor, she waited for the buzz to come swarming back to her ears in full force.
6:28 am
No buzzing. Maybe yesterday was just a fluke.
7:21 am
She sat at her kitchen counter, mushing her soggy Corn Flakes into the lukewarm milk. The TV remote sitting just to the left of her elbow taunted her. Her left arm twitched, as if it wanted to grab for the remote and switch on the first channel available, but she held off. The result was a counter drenched in soggy cereal and tepid milk.
7:24 am
She threw down the paper towel, accidently flinging more Corn Flakes across the newly clean counter. Her cracked flat screen TV blared to life as the morning newsman gave his daily weather report. Her finger trembled over the channel button. Another twitched switched the channel to a Spanish documentary. Except she understood almost every word as if it was native English. She held her finger down again and jumped channels until she stopped at the Vietnamese cooking show. She gripped the remote in her hand tighter as her brain automatically translated each word for her. 
A few channels over was a Portuguese sports show. She understood it just as well as every channel before.
7:32 am
A Japanese singing contest. No problem.
7:38 am
A Russian singing contest. Less musically appeal, just as comprehendible.
7:45 am
She stares at the crack in the now black screen. The twitch returned to her left hand so she dropped the remote down. The silence seemed to echo throughout her apartment. 
7:50 am
Was it really so bad to understand every language? Perhaps not. It could come in handy when traveling. Or when ordering at an ethnic restaurant. Maybe she could even get a job as an interpreter. 
But the problem wasn’t the power itself; more that a skill such as this shouldn’t pop up after a bad headache and 5 baby aspirin. "
15,"I was dying. 
There was no other way to describe the pain coursing through my veins, the pounding in my head. My mouth was dry, and I felt my knees buckle into the snow before I could stop them. I placed my palms against the sides of my head and tried to breathe. 
Through bleary eyes, I tried to take in my predicament. Not only did it appear I was about to kick the bucket, but I was now entirely alone. The merry band of weirdos who’d carted me into the middle of nowhere had conveniently vanished, leaving me to battle an invisible foe. After a few agonizing minutes, the pain began to ebb, and it appeared I was no longer in danger of spontaneously combusting. I lifted my hand to rub my eyes and nearly screamed. 
A swirl of orange danced across my palms, lighting my across my fingers. They flickered with the wind but refused to disappear. Certain I was likely already dead, I examined the strange flickers for a few moments. 
It didn’t take long to realize I was on fire. 
With a screech, I shoved my hands into the snow, waiting to feel the burn of melting flesh. Instead, I felt liquid pool around my wrists. The snow around my hands had melted, and the orange swirls continued to merrily dance. I sat back on my heels and took a second look. I didn’t smell anything rancid, and I wasn’t in pain. So how the hell was I on fire?
Perfect. Of all the disastrous scenarios I’d conjured for this hellish trip, I’d somehow missed this one. I still wasn’t entirely sure I wasn’t dead. 
A harsh gust of wind blew through the trees, and I realized night was falling. I was alone, I was hungry, and I was potentially a zombie. None of these boded well for the coming hours. The pool of liquid my hands had caused stirred my interest, however. Maybe if this fire didn’t hurt me, it could be of use. At the very least, it might save me from some nasty frostbite. 
Invigorated, I hoisted myself up and leaned against a tree as the world spun. A wisp of smoke drifted from the bark, and I retreated with a yelp. Right, I was apparently a fire hazard now as well. At least that was something new I could add to my college application. Maybe I could figure out how to light a fire with these bad boys too. The world was my oyster-better yet, the world was my inferno. 
My parents thought this camping trip would give me a spark. Who knew for once they’d be right? "
16,"This man, seeming so important, the average Joe, noticed something strange about himself one morning. Nothing he had done the day before was out of the ordinary. What he had done the day before was what he has always done for the past 5 years or so. He gets up, gets ready and goes to work. The same numbing routine at work. Everything scheduled to the last minute when he clocks out. But today, today from the moment he heard his alarm, was unusual. He got up the same way he has always rose every morning, first taking out his left foot while yawning, then his right. He proceeded to on, yet everything he did seemed strange, even though he had done today what he has been doing for the past 5 years. As he went on to shower he noticed that no matter how hot he would raise the water to him, that it did not feel hot. How can that be? He has had the same setting in the water temperature in his shower for the past 5 years. Knowing that he did not want to deviate from his routine, he decide that in his scheduled free time for the day, he would look into it. Next, making his breakfast he notice that the once always boiling hot oatmeal that he was used to, now was too cold as well. How could that be? He did not do anything different from any of the other times that he has made oatmeal. None of this was making any sense to him. But after all, it still seemed insignificant. Throughout the day he continued colder. He thought, “Maybe, this is just a cold?” His warmed toned skin by the end of the day now seemed a faint blue.  All these changes frightened him. After all he was a man that liked for everything to be normal, expected. He made "
17,"Katley was thinking. She had just went on her coffee run, and from time to time she had received a free iced coffee because she was one of the regulars. But she had been noticing something was a bit different. Her mom had made her breakfast upon a single request – and considering that her mother had not used the stove in five years, it was a strange occurrence. Suspicious, almost. Katley was a bit confused, but pleasantly surprised. 
Upon realizing that she was getting her way with just about everything, she decided to put it to the test. She called her friend Bryan who normally would never treat her to lunch, and asked “Hey, can we grab a bite? And would you mind spotting me today?” He replied with an enthusiastic “Yeah, of course!” and picked her up within the hour.
Katley was amazed. It was too much of a coincidence. Was she having a good day, or did she have a unique power of persuasion? She rolled her eyes at the thought, but nonetheless pondered. 
Throughout the day, she asked simple tasks of her peers to complete, and there was not one person who refused a request. She was beginning to think that it was not just luck – she had some sort of amazing talent. 
The week continued on like this, and left and right she was getting favors handed to her. She was enjoying this unique ability, but she was not sure to what extent her power would work. A smirk spread across her face in thinking about all the possibilities. Sure she could get a free lunch from time to time, but in really thinking about it, she realized she had complete and total control over everyone. Anyone in her life had become her pawn, and she realized that she could do just about anything. But she stopped… where would she start? 
She could change people’s votes for the upcoming election if she asked them to. She could go to concerts in asking for a free ticket. She could get her best friend to break up with her awful boyfriend. She could get her mom to take up cooking lessons. The real question was whether or not she would use her power for her own benefit, for the good of people…. "
18,"Every day, Sonny takes the same path the school; he walks down the road, through the ally, past the big oak tree, and enters the east side of campus. It’s one of his highlights every day. Having the time to be outside and enjoy the fresh air is amazing. 
However, on Wednesday morning, just as sonny looked over the gate to see the big oak, he took in a breath of fresh air and suddenly felt something strange. It was as if he wanted to choke on the air. It was an unpleasant feeling, but not unbearable, so he kept walking. He then started noticing some other strange things. It was as if he could feel the air more and sense the wind and hear nature’s voice around him. 
Sonny has always been close with the outdoors, but this was different. As he went through the day, his connection with air grew stronger and stronger. As he walked home from school and passed that big oak tree again, he definitely felt something weird. As Sonny breathed out, he suddenly felt the spirit of the tree. There was no real conversation, but from within Sonny recognized that he was biologically different from yesterday. 
His heart rate started increasing as he tried to catch his breath, only he couldn’t really breathe like before. It was as if oxygen was no good to him anymore. He froze in place and looked around. 
Feeling a little betrayed by this new connection he felt with his surroundings, he tried to block it out. To his despair, he could not stop feeling everything around him. He went back to the oak and sat down trying to make sense of things. As he sat and listened and felt, he found some equilibrium within himself and this tree. He realized that he had stopped uptaking oxygen and started breathing carbon dioxide. For some reason, he was able to hold in the carbon without it becoming toxic to his body. 
Sonny had become a human storage for carbon emissions. The next day on his way to school, he could feel everything that was being put out by the people surrounding him. From small scale light sources to huge pollution factors like diesel fuel trucks. Luckily, Sonny has the ability to withstand the carbon, but the amount of work it puts on his body may not last. 
Sonny began searching for new ways to store the extra carbon he had been taking in and as time went on, he became able to convert those emissions into clean air. Wherever Sonny went, he was simply breathe in toxic air and breathe out clean air, slowly cleaning up the streets of his community. With the help of environmental groups and renewable energy, Sonny was able to purify his entire city. 
As Sonny grows older, he commits himself to encourage growth of renewables, decrease use of fossil fuels, and traveling to as many places as possible so that he could absorb all of the atmospheric toxins and release purified air. "
19,"One day, Brian found out that he has the ability to change other people’s minds. It was the day before his midterm. He wrote an email to his TA, arranged an appointment and made her give him all the answers for the exam. After getting good scores on it, Brian walked down the street wondering what to eat. He goes into wood stock’s pizza. He orders a family size pizza with a lot of toppings. After that, he changes the cashier’s mind, just paying the price for a small size pizza. When Brian needs money for his rent, skateboard or a plane tickets, he would go downtown, making people there give him some pocket money. He could even make his favorite baseball team win all the games by messing up the opponents’ minds. His life was so much more comfortable than before. It seemed that he no longer has anything to worry about. As he’s been fully enjoying his new sweet lifestyle, Brian thought it would be right of him to use his ability for the world peace. He wanted to turn dictators and terrorists’ minds to stop posing threat to the world. However, to change their minds, Brian has to meet them in person, which is very dangerous for him. He started to think of ways to meet those people. He decided to visit his own nation’s president first to find solution. On his way to meet the president, Brian got into a car accident and lost his memory. What a poor guy. "
20,"As I lay there dreading the fact that I have to wake up in a few hours for school in which in fact I hate with a passion,  I get up to go to the bathroom. When I get up and go to open the door of my room I notice that it swings open by itself. I didn’t really think about it for a second being extremely tired and half asleep and carried on to the bathroom. When again I noticed that the bathroom door swung open right when I approached it. This time being a lot more awake I was startled and jumped back. Did I just move that with just my brain? I thought to myself, and then just out of curiosity and lots of dumb television shows that I would always watch racing through my head I tried to close the door shut. I didn’t believe my eyes when the door slowly closed shut as the thought had just passed through my mind of it closing. I gasped with my mouth wide open trying to realize if that really just happened or if I was just still dreaming. I went into to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror to see if it really was me and if there was anything wrong on my face or anywhere else. 
After staring at myself for a while I decided, that if I had just opened and closed those doors maybe I can somehow move objects with my mind. So I decided to test it again, I leered at my toothbrush and nothing happened, then out of nowhere it rose up and plunged itself right into my open grasp. Unbelievable I thought to myself and so I still found it hard to believe and tried moving anything else I could in the bathroom without making too much noise to wake anybody else up. I turned on and off the showers and still couldn’t believe that I can do such things. After a while of doing simple things for a good while I heard my brother waking up and walking down the hall so I hurried back into my room closing the door behind me with just my mind. I sat down at the edge of my bed and stared blankly onto the hard wood floor. Why me? I thought to myself why did I get this how can I say power. Out of all the people in the entire world, me. I thought to myself that maybe I’m just going crazy and just not realizing that this is all a giant dream and I will wake up and have to go to class in a bit, and this power will just go away. So I laid back down on my bed staring at the ceiling trying to fall back to sleep, trying to comprehend what had just happened and if it really did happen. "
21,"On a quiet day in the sunny small town of Applewood, a young girl and her mother were taking their daily walk around the neighborhood.  The young girl, Chloe, had just turned 8, and was feeling very giddy about getting out of the house and walking around.  It was that time of year where you could almost taste the spring, but there was still the chill of winter in the air.  Many of the trees were starting to get their green leaves back and this is what Chloe loved.  Ever since she was small, she had always felt at home in nature; she would sit outside in the grass as a toddler just soaking up the sun and watching the birds fly around in her trees.  Chloe was admiring a hydrangea bush that someone had neglected.  She was just thinking to herself, wouldn’t it just be great if the flowers were as bold and beautiful as they were last summer.  The little girl touched dried up bud and suddenly it bloomed, she gasped and stepped back.  Not only did the bud bloom but the whole bush nearly doubled in size and regained its color and luster.  Chloe was astounded.  “Did I just do that?” she thought, that’s impossible.  Her mother looked over her shoulder and said, “Keep up Chloe, Mrs. Noodle doesn’t like it when you mess with her lawn.”  Chloe caught up to her mom, she decided it would be best to stay quiet about what she had just seen.  As their walk progressed, Chloe began to touch all the plants she loved, each one blooming in turn; leaving in her path a glorious walk of different flowers and trees.  She looked behind her, proud of her accomplishment and new found green thumb.  From that day fourth she knew her life was about to change."
22,"Mark, a once regular teenage boy with a deep love for coffee, ponders his life while at a coffee shop. He has not yet been able to truly understand the new changes occurring in him.  Now every time he drinks coffee, he can hear people’s thoughts. 
Mark came upon this discovering weeks ago, but still hasn’t been able to figure out why, or what use it had. He would take a sip of coffee and suddenly the thoughts of others would pervade his own, an awkward situation at family breakfast. The peculiar thing was that drinking water would instantly turn off others thoughts, allowing Mark to have his own mind back. 
Mark’s picked up the coffee that was in front of him, eyeing it strangely. He couldn’t understand how such a delicious, normal substance could have those effects on him. There must be some reason why, or some use. The thoughts of others were unimportant to Mark, who preferred to not know what others think. 
While he was staring intensely at his cup of coffee, a young girl walked up to his table and sat across from him. After the actions elicited no responses from the extremely focused Mark, she made a soft coughing noise. Mark looked up with surprised and gasped. This girl, Sara, had been his crush for years, but he rarely spoke to her. Mark was always nervous around her and believed that she didn’t like him.
“Hi,” said Sara said with a sweet smile. “How are you?”
“Hi Sara. I’m…I’m great. You?” Mark answered nervously, trying not to look at her.
“I’m great, I just saw you sitting her and wondered if I could join you?” She asked, leaning forward slightly. 
“I uhm.. I would… uhm.. like that.” Mark replied, taking a sip of coffee to try and hid his nervousness. Instantly his head was filled with random thoughts from the people with in the café. 
“Great! It’s been so long since we have talked!” 
Suddenly, a thought came forward in Mark’s head. It was Sara’s. Sara was thinking about him! Sara liked him too! Mark knew then, the usefulness of his new power and its benefits. 
“Hey Sara, how about I buy you a cup of coffee and we go on a date?” Mark finally asked the question he had been dying to ask for years, and with an extra dose of confidence. "
23,"One day, there was a little girl name Stella she lived in a big white house with her family. They lived in the rural areas and they cultivated fruits and agriculture in their home plantations. They were great family, Stella had two younger brothers and she was the oldest. Stella was about fifteen years old and she always looked after her younger brothers. Stella cared a lot about the environment and the flowers that her dad and had planted all along their huge garden. However, one morning when she was going to water the plants she noticed that someone had destroyed all her flowers and some of the chickens were missing. 
Stella and her family were very confused as to why someone would do such a thing. The entire town had been vandalized. The people from other towns were having a hard time with their plantations and they were starving. Everyone on the nearby towns were having a problem with their agriculture. The next morning Stella began riding her horse to the nearby towns but on the way she had an accident. Stella fell and hit her head. She was unconscious for about an hour when a couple from the troubled town helped her wake up. Stella was scared of them but when she looked at how helpful they were she wished she could help their agriculture plantations. She asked if she could go to their plantations and take a look at the crops.
When she arrived her head still hurt and she could feel a lot of pain. She felt different out of place, not only because she was surrounded by sorrows faces all around. When she finally reached to the tomato plantations she touch the root of the plant and noticed something bizarre as she touched it. When she touch it her hand changed to a camouflaged color and texture of the crops roots. She stepped away immediately and became disgusted with her hands. Everyone in the town gasped as they noticed her hand. She became very paranoid and thought about how she had hit her head and if that might have had an influence in her supernatural power. 
She ran as fast as she could, crying and feeling confused. When she got to her house she sat by her flowers and touched them. Like the first time it happened, when she touched her hand became part of the flower. However, this time she left it there for a bit longer and noticed something unusual. There appeared a shiny light as well when she touched it. She noticed that the roots had become green and slowly the flower came to life. She ran to the front porch of her house and she told her parents. They were very scared first but once she demonstrated how she had cured the flowers. Stella then helped everyone in the nearby towns with their crops. She was glad she had helped everyone."
24,"This is a short story about a young girl named McKenzie. She lives with her brother and parents in a beach community in Oceanside, Ca. One day, McKenzie was walking to school with her brother having a perfectly normal conversation when all of a sudden he started to cry. McKenzie wanted to know what was going on in her brother’s head and why he was so upset. She asked him, what was the matter and he ignored the question and kept walking. This made McKenzie very angry and she walked faster to get away from her brother. This may seem odd to the average person; however, McKenzie’s brother was always very emotional and stand off-ish when it came to expressing his feelings. Ever since they were little her brother would never open up to her or her parents. This worried McKenzie and she wished that she could somehow get inside her brothers head to understand what he was going through. She felt as though this had put a great negative cloud over their relationship. The siblings arrived at school and attended their classes just like any other day. Throughout the day, McKenzie found herself thinking about her brother and pondering over all the reasons why he would be acting so strangely. She could not focus on her work and spent the whole day worrying about her brother.
After school was out, McKenzie and her brother began to walk home. McKenzie stared into her brother’s eyes and saw he was still upset. Suddenly, she heard his voice. However his lips were not moving. How was this possible?! She could hear all his thoughts and understood all his pain. Her brother’s mind was filled with sadness and McKenzie was taken back by all the upsetting thoughts and fears. She hugged her brother and reassured him that everything would be okay. She now understood the difficulty of sharing all the thoughts and emotions. She told him that they have an unbreakable bond as siblings and she would always be there for him. McKenzie’s brother was taken back at first, shocked and surprised by the sudden embrace by his sister.  However, he did feel a strong connection to his sister and this made him feel better. McKenzie did not know what came over her that day or how she was able to understand and really feel her brother’s pain. However, she knew that her frustration with her brother must be pushed aside and that all she could do was simply be there for him. "
25,"It was happening again; the days dragged on wearily and fate put me in this position, against the wall, with my tormentors breath in my face, spewing words of vehement and terror. I could smell the cigarettes on his breath, which choked the little life out of my pitiful existence. Time had seemed to stop for me then, and I could feel the pain of the many times before this, where the smell of cigarettes invaded my senses, and I choked as a knife was held against my skin.
His father must have been beating him again; reasoning to why he chose me to torment, a representation about the horrors of his own life, which he now chose to vent out upon my existence. The cycle was vicious, and the pain caused destroyed the little happiness I had built. All my friends had left me, warry of the pain they’d suffer if they chose to get in the way. It was a pitiful existence, and it led to this day, where blood was meant to leak upon the pavement, and my life was to end. 
“I want to see you bleed,” his words were seething, and the knife sliced the skin of my neck just in the slightest, sending pain trickling through my body. Blood dripped down my neck, staining the shirt my uncle gave me, before he went to the war, giving his life overseas to make ours easier. I believed in his sacrifice, but now it seemed that my death was coming, and no help would be in sight.
The blade struck violently, my neck being torn to shreds and vision ran black, and utter coldness filled my body. A voice whispered, flitting through the mists of my thoughts and reached my ear.
“Power, given to stop such evils. Power for those who wish to take it, and use it for their own desires. Power in the face of injustice. Death smiles upon you today boy.” And with that, a coldness entered my body, a coldness that carried strength through my body. I stood up, watching as the bloody tormentor looked in horror at my gaunt face and deathless eyes. I reached out to him, and reaped his soul straight from his body, tearing through his chest with my grim hands, all in a dark mist, which resonated from the ground. The next words came through, from a memory long ago:
“I am death, the destroyer of worlds,” and with that a scythe materialized in a purple mist, and my eyes grew dark. I realized what I had been given, a power to correct the evils of man, to fight like my uncle did long ago. In my death, the reaper was born.    "
26,"Don was heading down the hill back to school with his rowing mates. They’d just finished practice and were deadbeat tired. Coming around a blind corner, he barely caught glimpse of a lady flagging them off the roadside. Without thought he pulled over to the side, and that’s when he noticed a car tumbled upsidedown perched over the edge of the cliff. Sprinting out of his jeep, he reckognized the car as his teammates’ and on approach noticed the car was empty. Peering over the edge he saw his friend sprawled out on a small ledge jutting out from the cliff. Bursting with adrenaline he slides down the Cliffside barely landing on the ledge beside his friend and checks his vitals. “2 broken ribs,” Don snaps them back together. “A broken leg and shattered knee,” Don squeezes life back into them, restoring them better than they had ever been before. A few moments of utter chaos pass as he proceeds to diagnose and heal all of his friend’s wounds. Done. He looks down at his watch. Three minutes have passed. That’s when it hits him. “………….what did I just do………….and how?” Without having taken so much as an anatomy class, Don had not  only saved  his friend’s life, but made it better. The friend began to regain consciousness. Don looked at his hands, wondering how he could have done these things. Then he looked at Jordan. Jordan felt his body and began to stand up, completely bewildered at what was going on. “Am I dead?” he asks Don. “No,” Don says, “I think I just…I think…oh my god……..OH MY GODDD!!!!!!!!!!!” There was no denying it now. Don understood what he had done. His new magical healing powers, coursing through his veins. Looking at Jordan, it couldn’t have been more clear. All the cuts were gone, no more blood. All his bones fully functioning and strong. Don blinked once, twice in awe. He looked Jordan in his eyes. Jordan looking back, A slight grin curved up on Don’s face. This was just the beginning."
27,"I always thought I was very good at reading people. Do you know those “how well do you perceive other people’s emotions” questions on job applications? I always put “very well” as the response. I always could sympathize with other people and understand other people’s train of thought as if I were able to become them. I can predict their immediate actions and their emotions following afterwards. It was a bit strange but I prided myself on it. 
One day my sister came home very frustrated from work. She slammed the door closed when she first walked in and had a visible scowl on her face. 
“What’s wrong now?” I asked. I was well aware of my sister’s hatred for her waitressing job. Money was tight and she couldn’t afford to quit it even though the food industry is one of the most stressful areas to work in. 
“We were busy all day. Aaaaall day, y’know. I understand that these customers are hungry and want a good dining experience but that shouldn’t mean you can treat the staff like trash! I had this one woman call me incompetent for not having ‘the burger bun toasted just right.’ Why would she say that if I’m not the one cooking!? Also this family thought it was ok for their little brats to start squeezing the ketchup and mustard bottles all over the table. Oh and this old man thought that if he flirted with me he would get a free meal!”
I listened to her ramble on and on and offered her my support. Later that night, I was thinking about what she said. It stuck with me. Her anger and frustration all clouded my mind and it was making me mad too. Why would people treat others that way? Why! She doesn’t get paid enough for this.
The morning after, I woke up and did my usual routine. Got out of my PJ’s, and gather my things to go shower. I almost was groggy enough to pass walking by the bathroom mirror until I noticed a familiar bleached blonde hair bun in the reflection. I looked back in the mirror and saw the face of my own sister looking right at me! I inspected myself over and over again until I confirmed it. I had shapeshifted into my sister!
My shock wasn’t nearly as bad as the migraine I suddenly realized. I can bet I know where the source of that came from. I opened the medicine cabinet, grabbed some pain pills, and ran as fast as I could to my sister’s room.
“I think you might need these!” I yelled, surprised that even my voice changed to hers."
28,"The wind had escaped her completely. As she finally took notice of what was actually happening, she dreamt of how easy it had been before. A time when her worries were only as big as her heart could handle, and everything had not been so complex. She was not quite sure when it happened, but at some point things began to spiral out of control, and it call became more than her mind could fathom. This blow to her being was a reminder of that moment when things had changed, and in this very moment, she craved to taste that simplicity at least one more time.
Lia was a typical grunge girl. Everything about her screamed diversity, and some people found this appealing about her, and others did not. She often got lost in the midst of the divine world that circled around her, yet she did not mind it. It was something about letting herself go night after night that made her feel whole. She longed to feel that way forever, but when the sun came out she returned to her rigid daily routines. Oddly, this did not bother her either. Most people identify with day or night, sun or moon, but she found a balance between the two. It was not until she met him that her mind began to step away from this ideology.
Dustin was a lot like Lia in ways she hoped to forget. She resented him for his brooding character, and actually began to develop a sort of hatred for him. They never saw eye to eye, which led them into constant arguments. Dustin was not serious about his schoolwork, and he took note of Lia’s double life as he had been watching her for a while. If he had not been watching from afar one night, it could have been Lia’s last night.
A dark cloud engulfed the ground she had been walking in her path home, and from the cloud came a man displaying a radiant purple aura. He touched her skull, and in that instant he vanished before she hit the ground. Dustin rushed to her side, and nursed her back to consciousness. When she awoke, her hands began radiated the same purple color as her attacker. To their amazement, Lia was now able to manipulate basic elements.
They walked into a patch of woods to test her abilities, and as they had noticed before, she was now able to move air, water, and wind together. Each time she used her powers however, her strength began to decrease. SS"
29,"After snoozing her alarm for the 6th time, Jiya awoke reluctantly, dreading looking at the clock. She didn’t even want to know how late she was. However, much to her surprise her clock still read 7:00 am. Thinking her vigorous snoozing had broken the clock she checked her phone, and then her wall clock and then sat on her bed utterly confused. She knew she had stopped the alarm at least 6 times and there would be no way that it could still be 7:00 am. In her groggy morning logic, she reconciled that she didn’t hit snooze that many times and happily hopped into the shower. However, when she came out and saw that the clock still said 7:00 her happiness turned to fear. Had she woken up in some weird dream? Was this a form of hyper conscious sleep paralysis? As she watched the clock, unmoving and perfectly still, she began to desperately wish for time to move on. And to her absolute shock, the clocks seemed to hear her. She watched as it became 7:01 and then 7:02 and time picked up, flying by as it always had. On a gut feeling, she decided to test out a theory. She wished again for time to stop. And as the wish reverberated through her, the seconds hand froze. This sent her into hysterics. This was the future. A world where time obeyed her needs. 
A dedicated student, Jiya still wanted to go to class. She allowed time to resume its natural course and got ready for class. By the time she got to her lecture hall, it was only 7:30. As she waited impatiently in an empty lecture hall, she absentmindedly wished it was already 8am so class could just start. In the blink of an eye (literally) the lecture hall was filled with students, the professor stood in the front of class ready to begin his lecture, and the clock on the wall read 8:00 am. Jiya leaned back, reveling in her newfound control, the perfect tool for a busy, sleep deprived student. "
30,"Bret was letting his mind wander in the middle of studying when something bizarre happened. Bret began to get distracted by the glass of water in front of him and started ponder over the existence of water itself. The more he thought the more the surface of the water rippled. At first he thought it was because of his foot tapping but when he stopped, the water didn’t. A slight panic overcame him as he thought that an Earth quake was about to begin. The remained still at this moment, leaving him puzzled. Bret watched the glass intensely and noticed small waves began to swish from side to side until he shift his gaze to a bug near the glass. The moment his attention shifted to the bug, a fast spout of water flew from the glass, landing directly at the bug. At this moment he knew he had some kind of power. He dipped his finger into the glass and immediately he could feel the vibrations of each molecule moving and flowing past one another. Along with the mineral molecules in the water. His attention shifted to now trying to align the molecules in a rigid structure, which turn the water into a perfectly clear piece of ice, as if nothing was in the glass at all. Amazed by this discovery, Bret went down to the ocean with his surf board with the idea of controlling the waves. Sure enough he was able to control the waves with just his thoughts. Bret would become the most famous surfer in history, being known for not only catching a perfect wave every time, but also for riding waves that were considered to be a guaranteed suicide for even professional surfers. The end. "
31,"After years of obsessing over my favorite heroes, wondering about what superpower I would have in their universes...it’s finally happened. 
Yes, I think I actually have a superpower.
After all these years of exposing myself to radiation, nuclear waste spills, radioactive spiders, and whatever else: I finally have a superpower.
I mean, it’s superhuman…that’s for sure. An incredibly underwhelming superpower, I have to admit. It is the ability to know who hasn’t washed their hands after using the bathroom. 
It’s weird, I know. But it wasn’t always like this. One day I was in the bathroom, doing my business, and I heard someone in the stall next to me talking about world domination and executing all humans or something like that. The details get kind of fuzzy. But then I heard a flush and then peeked through the crack in front of my own stall. 
An older lady in an orange business suit walked out, looked at herself in the mirror, and made eye contact with me. Her green eyes were menacing as hell. She opened her mouth and I heard a loud bang come from above her and I just blacked out.
I opened my eyes.
She was gone. 
I didn’t know what happened in that moment, and I don’t know what she did to me. But I knew she didn’t wash her damn hands. 
It was more than just a feeling, I knew I had the power to do something great. To change the world and make sure no one gets sick from rubbing their dirty little hands all over the goddamn place.
I walked out of that stall with a purpose. First, I washed my hands while singing along to the tune of “Happy Birthday,” because apparently that is the amount of time that is recommended to get rid of the germs. I don’t know who said that, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t true. At least I wash my hands after I use restrooms. 
Then I kicked open that bathroom door. 
“I have a message to the people of this fine fast food establishment!” I exclaimed. 
I caught the cashier person side-eyeing me.
“Please restrain yourself from kicking open our doors, Ma’am,” they nonchalantly requested.
“I’m sorry. But it’s not just because of your door. I’m sorry that you’re about to get whooped because I know you haven’t washed your hands before serving these fine customers.”  
I smiled. Then I walked out of the building because apparently I broke the door and they were about to call the cops. 
But I knew this was the start of something magical. The people around might not realize it yet, but I’m here to stay. And I’m here to change the world. Just call me “Germaphobe.”"
32,"There lived a boy who throughout his whole life, lived it as if it was new.
So strange to think, that with wonder and knack, he could influence himself and you.
For this boy learned much through the years of his life
Living and growing as a man.
Till one day he saw, that some expected, a natural reaction to events.
That some would look-up, and some would look-down, but all would look knowing what’s seen
“Why is this?” the boy asked, “That all seem to know, of things I can and can’t do? I know nothing of them, they know nothing of me, but I know they see something indeed?”
It then dawned on the boy; that perhaps his own folly relied in his self-perception.
No longer a boy, was he considered, by the rest of the world around him.
Indeed it seemed, with age came some powers, and the boy had to cope with these.
“Is this what it means, to be a man? To hold power with trust in each other? That I’d act as expected, knowing full well, that they’d act as expected towards me? Do I know what’s expected? Do I know what to be? Is the trust that is placed, a trust I believe? No… I think not, for man makes mistakes, and I know one thing most verily. I will refuse this power, for I know at a glance, that one cannot truly know thee.”
So the boy lived on, not playing his role as was expected of society.
Instead he found others, that questioned the same, and thought of possibility."
33,"It was a sunny Sunday morning when Alexander had awakened with an eerie feeling that he could not shake off. “What is this weird unshakable feeling that I have?” asked Alexander to himself as he stretched his arms wide, letting out a yawn. He stood out of his bed, washed his face, and called for his dog by snapping his fingers. As soon as he snapped his fingers it seemed to cause an a combustion reaction, allowing for fire to be stationary at the tips of his index finger and thumb. Like every normal person, Alexander freaked out, fell on his ass, and accidently lit hit towel on fire. The fire alarms at his house went off and his roommates were soon awakened. Alexander suffered no burns from the fire, as if he was immune. He told his roommates that there was a short-circuit that had occurred, and the sparks just happened to light up his towel. Alexander didn’t know what was going on, and began to think about the experience that had just happened. As he had changed in his clothes, he began to walk to class, while listening to his favorite song at the time, AC DC’s Highway to Hell. He snapped his fingers to the beat, and notice that he was able to create tiny sparks from the friction between his fingers. He realized that the eerie feeling he felt earlier had something to do with this. He focused on his hand, and soon enough a big ball of fire had been created, resting on the palm of his hand, leaving him without injury. He realized that there was something not “normal” with him, but why now. Why did this power suddenly manifest itself while Alexander was in college. He had never suffered from any burn wounds before, and he suddenly remembered a time in his childhood when he ate a burning marshmallow and did not feel a thing. Suddenly, he realized that he had the option to become a source of good, or source of evil with his new found ability. That’s when he remembered Uncle Ben from Spider-Man (the good movies, not that Andrew Garfield rendition). He noted Uncle Ben’s words “With great power comes great responsibility.” Those words resonated in his head. He began to think about how he could use his power to help humanity. Immediately, Alexander started to sprint towards the nearest fire station, in an attempt to convince these veteran firefighters who put their lives on the line everyday in the most extreme situations, to allow a 19 year old college student to join them. While on his way though, destiny caught up to him, and to his left, he saw a smoky building filled with cries for help. Without hesitation, Alexander put on the hoodie to his sweater, kicked the door down, and ran into the scorching flames within the building. The building felt at room temperature for him, it was such a strange feeling, but the smoke would still have an effect on him, so he knew he had to get out of there as soon as possible. He heard the cries of a young college student named Heather, who was trapped in her room as a result of all the fire. Alexander yelled, “I am here to help you! Please stay where you are!” He ran through countless flames, tackled the door, and there she was barely able to breathe. Without hesitation, Alexander ran up to her, put her on his shoulders, and jumped out of the window into the neighbor’s pool. As they came crashing down, Alexander allowed the professionals to check up on Heather, as people began to surround the burning building and help soon came to put it out, Alexander realized that he has now started a life that comic book heroes deal with. He looked at his hand, and noticed it to be still be on fire. That’s when he woke up, alarm ringing, late to class, and as he went to grab his towel, it was nowhere to be found. "

35,"There was a girl whose name was Zelia Mayteather. She was trying to survive her last year of high school without getting into more trouble than usual. One day she was walking home when she saw the boy she had been crushing on since her freshman year, Christopher Ortiz. She went into a panic seeing as she had woken up late and didn’t have enough time to shower, so she stood there in the middle struck with embarrassment. Although, to her surprise her walked right through her. After recovering from the fact that she managed to avoid him she realized that he literally walked right through her, it’s not that he didn’t notice her or that he walked around her, but his body just passed through hers as if she was a ghost. In that moment, panic overcame her body. Was she dead? Was she a ghost? She had just talked to her mom on the phone, was that not real? Scared of the thousand possibilities she ran rom and burst through the front door. Yelling throughout the house, until she came across her mother who got her in trouble for being so loud. She leaped onto her mother and wrapped her arms around her as she realized she was perfectly fine. At dinner she remained silent as she couldn’t stop thinking why Christopher had just walked on by, or how! Once she was in bed, she decides to stroll through social media and see what the world was up to. She comes across Christopher’s page and decides to send him a message, surprised at her new found confidence she mentions that she saw him on his walk home. To make things stranger, he claims that he never saw anyone on his walk home. Now wondering if it was a bad idea to message him, she starts to panic when the laptop fall directly through her onto the bed. Amazed by what happened, she stared in awe. She then came to the conclusion that every time she got nervous she would “disappear.” Amazed at this new found power of hers she goes to bed ready to test it out tomorrow. When the next day arrives, Zelia wakes up groggy as she couldn’t sleep knowing she had powers. When she looks at the clock she freaks out as it is already late. You can hear mom’s steps coming up the stairs, and once she bursts in to yell at Zelia, she is nowhere to be found. Realizing she was using her powers she carefully walks to the bathroom and starts showering for school. Star struck by her powers, she uses it on little things such as pranks and teasers until she spots Christian across the cafeteria. She walks over and starts to talk to him, throughout the conversation she can’t help but wonder what has possessed her to make her so confident. She then forgets that he was talking and when he catches her daydreaming she freaks out and disappears. She begins to panic as he starts to freak out on how she was just there a second ago. As much as she wants to be visible she realizes she hasn’t learned how to control her powers. She walks away hoping to reappear soon, and to her misfortune, she appears right as she’s leaving the cafeteria and everyone sees the tears running down her face as she feels she ruined every possible chance with Christopher."
36,"Once there was a girl. She was walking home from school on a rather uneventful day, wondering how life could be more boring or repetitive than it already was. Staring at the houses that looked the same, the streets that looked the same, the trees, the flowers, the lampposts that all looked the same, she stumbled upon a rock- which did not look like any normal rock. 
Just based on appearance, this glass rock with a fire burning within it awed her. FINALLY, she thought. Something peculiar and interesting in the middle of my mundane life. With curiosity and wonder, she picked up the rock, examined it, and put it in her pocket. After a couple of days, this rock didn’t seem to do anything at all other than look beautiful. She frustratingly threw the rock away and it burst into a huge fiery ball, engulfing her for just a second, and then disappeared. 
“This is something straight out of a superhero movie! I’m going to have the ability to breathe and control fire, humidity, and nature! I’m going to make the most of my life, saving lives and creating a beautiful world!” But she was wrong. 
For the next couple weeks she noticed nothing strange about herself at all. There was no change in her abilities, and she continued to live a painstakingly boring life. Was the rock just a dream? Did she imagine it happening to her purely because her life was just that pathetic? Maybe. Maybe not…
As college acceptances rolled out, her & her best friend were walking around college campuses, discussing which schools they thought they would be accepted to. “I have 0% chance of getting into any college, I swear…” She had no confidence in herself or her future. 
And she was right. Out of the 21 colleges she applied to, she was accepted to absolutely none of them. Her future was going to be living in her parent’s basement until she died alone. 
“How could this be? How can I have not even been accepted to a single college? This has got to be a mistake. I’m 100% sure I could have been accepted to all of these. I can’t believe this.” 
And… she was right. A couple days later, all 21 colleges sent her acceptance letters in the mail, telling her they had made a mistake and would love for her to attend their college. 
-Narrator’s cut- 
You’re probably wondering what’s happening right now. Well this girl (let’s call her Jackie) has just obtained the power to make statistics come true. She doesn’t know it yet, but this could be the greatest power of all, she could potentially say “There’s a 100% chance that I will close my eyes, and open them again to find myself in Ethiopia”, and that would come true. Or “There’s a 100% chance that I will be able to fly and soar throughout the sky”, and she’d find herself amongst the birds and the clouds. If you really wanted to take it to the next level she could say “There’s a 100% chance that anything I think about or imagine in my head, will come true as long as I say it aloud”. And then she wouldn’t even have to manipulate statistics anymore, she would just have to say everything out loud and it would be done. 
So, let’s find out what Jackie chooses to do with her newfound power…
Fin. To not be continued. "
37,"She paused, staring at him with a frown that creased the sliver of flesh between her eyebrows. What was wrong with him? All she ever wanted to do was help, and he stood there, daring to deny her the use of her newfound ability. The cut on his hand was fresh, dripping with blood that could have well been made from droplets of rubies. He could sense what she was mulling over in her head and sternly said her name, as if it was a warning; “Kalani.”
The woman cleared her throat and looked back up to lock his amber gaze with her cinereous one. Kalani had been in charge, once before, and now this man she had grown fond of was so locked in on his own superiority that he felt as though he could order her to do anything. But she wasn’t one of his lackeys, one of his dogs that he could command and growl at. The blonde had slowly caught on, and she knew that he was fond of her as well. If he had any sense left in his bones, the Captain would not deny her the use of her power. 
Still, she didn’t know the extent of what she could do. Not until that moment. At first, she noticed her own bruises disappearing in a matter of moments, small cuts closing up like they were never meant to brandish her skin. But was it possible for her to heal others, specifically the man before her whose rougue-ish look took her breath away? He dared say she couldn’t, and the look in his face told her that, even if she could, he didn’t want her to. 
Again, he spoke her name, much firmer than before. “Kalani, don’t.”
With as little response as she had self-control, the woman snatched his palm in her hand and covered it with the other. The Captain immediately attempted to jolt free of her grip, but it was too late. He felt the pain in his hand ebb, and once he could rip it away from her, the flesh was without any flaws, just his usual callouses from working on the ship for many hours. 
Kalani, on the other hand, had cringed and pulled her hands away just as quickly as he had pulled his own from her. Why did it hurt? She had healed him, which was an accomplishment in and of its own, but why was she, herself, hurting? The blonde looked down at both her palms. What she found made her gasp and the Captain frown, a look of guilt shining across his eyes.
There, in the same, correlating side that the man’s wound had occurred, lay a cut that could have mirrored his own. The woman watched the liquid rubies leak from under her skin. “I took it from you.” She looked back at the Captain, whose face had taken on a dark look before he carefully gripped her chin between his fingers so she would hear all that he was saying to her. 
“You tell no one that you have this power. Do you hear me? No one can know. Hell, I shouldn’t even know.” He cleared his throat and frowned again. “Never use this ability on anyone, ever. Not even me.”
Again, there he was, commanding her around. But this time, there was something in his voice that made such commands sound more like a plea. As if he could have been begging her to not go back on his words. So she abided and cast him a quiet nod."
38,"Mike was ecstatic- he had just won the position of class president, and he was filled to the brim with ideas as to how to improve his school. As a senior, he wanted to leave a legacy, and this new position of power was a dream to him; he could finally create change in his community.
However, as time went on, his excitement started to fade. Mike had tried to create spirit within his senior class, and tried to get them involved in the decisions he was making, but he realized that there was such a thing as too much democracy. Even for the color of their class t-shirts, red or white, the class split into two sides, and an uproar occurred. When white had won, the students who had chosen red began to resent Mike.
This happened in all of Mike’s decisions; there were always ones left unhappy, and they blamed Mike for their unhappiness. Mike cared deeply for his image, and hated that his position of power had left him less liked than before. He knew having the power that he did came with many responsibilities, and that there were sacrifices that must be made, but that didn’t stop him from resenting his presidency. He hated that the students so easily blamed him for everything he tried to do- choosing prom locations, allocating funds, choosing dates for events. He wanted his peers to realize how much time and effort he put in to get everything together. The president from last year did next to nothing, and was disliked for his apathy; Mike was the opposite, and there was still opposition- could Mike ever win?
“This must be how politicians feel,” Mike thought. Regardless of their decisions, there were always those who were in opposition of them.
On a brighter note, Mike was now known throughout the school, not always in the light he wanted to be cast in, but his presence throughout the school was known. He realized that he really could not please everyone, and that didn’t make him a bad leader. Besides, there were many who saw Mike’s effort in revamping the school and class, and who gave him credit for that. As the year came to a close, Mike was relieved to be lifted of his responsibility; power was not all that it was cracked up to be. But he was also very proud of his accomplishments for the school. It was much improved within the last year than it had been in the past five before that. Although he may not have received the recognition he had hoped for, he had an internal sense of pride, and had accomplished what he had originally intended to do. "
39,"One day, a man named Rob was coming back from his family’s funeral after a mass-murderer had brutally killed Rob’s daughter and wife. Rob who now became a man with nothing to lose had started to lose faith in humanity along with his own sense of humanity. Rob drank alcohol for five consecutive days in order to hide his sorrows. One late night, Rob went for a stroll around his neighborhood pondering about his meaning of life. All of a sudden, there was a loud crash which immediately caught Rob’s attention. After a minute of silence, Rob decided to head over as he did not hear any voices from the direction of the crash. A small crater with a circumference of about the size of a basketball was directly in front of Rob. There was still smoke coming out of the crater when suddenly a sharp glimmer caught Rob’s attention. In an instant, a shadowy object darted into Rob’s face…
The sunlight was shining as bright as ever and Rob was awoken by the sun’s gleaming rays. “Where am I…What happened…>?”, he said. The crater was still in front of Rob and the last recollection of his memories was of him taking a stroll at night to discover a mysterious crater. Then he remembered that something about the crater startled him. *Voosh* Rob had just seen a bench beside him get distorted for a brief moment. “What the-” Rob became nervous and thought something had happened to his eyes. He rushed back to his house opening the restroom door wide open as he nervously checked every corner of his eyes. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. *sigh* “I guess nothing really happened after all… But why did I become unconscious?”, Rob said. 
*Beep Beep Beep* Rob’s phone was ringing. “Sir! I would like to ask about how things are at the moment..” “Yeah, I’m feeling a bit better. I should be able to head back to the company today after lunch.”, Rob said. “Alright, everyone will be waiting to welcome you, sir!” "
40,"Feldrich had just finished his math test when and was exiting the classroom in the building when he suddenly felt an outrageous sensation of hunger and realized that he hadn’t eaten sense that morning before school almost eight hours ago. Hurriedly, he rushed to his car to in the parking lot to drive to the Mexican restaurant down the road and grab one of his favorite carne asada burritos. The moment Feldrich hopped in his car and sat down he immediately closed his eyes and began dreaming about the delicious meat, salsa, rice and beans that would be inside the burrito and his mouth began to water at the thought of it. He decided he better not waste any time fantasizing about the food, and so he snapped out of his temporary dream-state and began to start up the car. No sooner did Feldrich become aware of a very pleasant, familiar smell in the car, and he attempted to locate the source. Upon turning around and searching the back seat of the station wagon, he was met face to face with a massive, untouched carne asada burrito on a golden platter sitting right on the seat behind him. Feldrich was blinded by the fortunate surprise and slapped himself several times rapidly in hopes of waking up from the dream he was certainly in. Despite these efforts, the burrito remained on the seat, tempting as ever, so Feldrich lunged for it and began devouring the thing like a wolf would a rabbit. Never in his entire existence on the planet had he ever experienced a satisfaction so powerful and magical, yet he questioned the source of the wondrous surprise. After school the next day, Feldrich once again realized his intense hunger and rushed to his car to speed off to grab a bite to eat. He conjoured up a burrito once again. Feldrich was magical"
41,"He was unaware of when it had happened. Or rather, he quite vividly recalled his first experience, but had no idea at what point he was capable of causing such an event. It happened several months ago, when at the start of the semester, he found himself sitting next to a particularly friendly fellow in class. After having talked to him for some time after the conclusion of lecture, he shook his hand goodbye as he promised to hang out with him outside of class. At that moment it hit him, like a powerful wave in a stormy sea, a sensation so overwhelming that it nearly brought him to his knees on the spot. In that second of contact with this individual he had never met, he had immediately come to know everything about him. He could not explain it, but "
42,"It had always puzzled Spencer why after the accident she hadn’t had any side effects. Everyone else seemed to have developed some strange traumatic brain injury, in fact some had even gone comatose. But Spencer, as far as she knew was fine. Spencer was always the bookish type, never really spent time outside; she was certainly charismatic and not what anyone would consider a shut-in, but her distaste for the outside was a notable feature of her personality. 
A long day had passed, Spencer walked out of her court-mandated therapy that everyone involved in the accident had to attend. This was a stressful time for her. What was wrong with her; why didn’t she have any problems? Why was she destined to live when everyone she had been with that day had died? Survivor’s guilt seemed like such a strange concept to her until she was in the middle of it. 
“God what is wrong with me!” she screamed out of exhaustion. She knelt down into the grass and did an action that some would consider the precursor to crying – not Spencer though, she hadn’t cried for months. 
“Believe me, nothing is wrong with you,” said a strange voice. Spencer turned around expecting this to be possibly the beginning of one of those cheesy romance movies and it would be the man of her dreams saving her from her existential crisis. Curiously though, nothing was there. She turned her head, looked to see if there was anywhere anyone was hiding but no – just the green grass she had knelt into. For a moment, she felt filled with a piety she had never felt before. 
“Ggggod? Is it you?” 
“On the contrary you are the God.” Well this was it for Spencer, she had finally suffered her traumatic brain injury and no longer felt her guilt. 
“I’m crazy,” she then began to cry. As she did this a small worm slithered up to her face and caught her tear. 
“Do not cry goddess, you are safe among your people,” the worm seemed to say. Spencer screamed. Did a worm just talk to her? And more importantly did a worm just catch her tears (and if so how thoughtful)? “Spencer,” it said in its strangely high pitched voice, “you have been given the gift. The gift of wormspeech. Many years ago it was prophesized that the wormspeaker would come to us in the form of a troubled, indoors girl who would find her people among the worms”. Spencer, believing she had gone into a psychotic state simply went along with it. “Not only that, but you can control us, here come up boys!” Suddenly a group of five worms popped out of the ground and began to bow. 
“This is Yarm, Harlo, Uback, General Tsao, and Peggy” the original worm said. “These are my siblings, and I, Campbell would love to be your worm liaison”. 
“This can’t be happening to me,” said Spencer incredulously. 
Campbell whistled a military grade whistle, “Friends of Spencer go steal that grey Toyota”. Suddenly an entire colony of worms emerged from the ground and found their way into the Corolla and started this car. 
“See,” Campbell said, “The accident you were in, it severely damaged your friends because they could not handle this burden of wormspeek. You are different Spencer. You are the chosen one. You can control any worm to your bidding and for that you are our God”. "
43,"Suddenly I was walking through the large lecture hall, on my way to my usual seat in the fourth row, 3 seats in, when I heard someone whispering. I pretended not to hear, because typically when someone is whispering they do not want it to be known. Even though the comment was about me, I chose to ignore it. Guys often comment on my body so I was used to it. I simply sat in my seat and opened my laptop while chewing my gum and texting the cute guy next door. The professor arrived in the lecture hall promptly at 2 pm, at which time the constant whispering around me stopped. Finally, peace. The professor goes on to talk about the upcoming test and what we should study, when I hear another voice. I hear “You will all fail so don’t even try to study.” I thought this was odd that a professor would encourage this. Next to me, a girl exclaims “Dr. Smith is the hottest professor I’ve ever known.” I was shocked she would actually admit that out loud. Doesn’t that cross some legal law?? Dr. Smith acted like he didn’t even hear…he must be used to it. I mean, he is pretty good looking for a 60 year old. I carried on taking notes. After class ended, Sharon and I began our daily walk to the lunch line. While in line, Sharon commented on my ugly sweater. I was offended, and since I am very sensitive, I began to cry. Sharon just looked at me confused, but the man next to me looked at me and shouted “Stop crying I am on the phone with my mistress!” I couldn’t believe it. I ran back home in tears. Sharon ended up texting me, “Why did you leave? Why were you crying?” That was when I realized my power. I, Lily Powers, could read minds. NOOOOOO, I thought to myself. Now I had to listen to everyone’s terrible, gossipy thoughts all day long. I was so upset I called my mom who lives in another state. My mom didn’t believe me, in fact, I heard her think “my daughter needs to be in a psych ward.” I was annoyed. I needed to find the silver lining. So, I went to the cute boy I was texted earlier. Cute boy, AKA Jeffrey, happened to also be on the football team at my school. As I made my way to football practice, I planned my next move. The team all gathers in the locker room after practice where it is notorious to talk about girls and all of that boy stuff. It is every girl’s DREAM to hear what they talk about. Now I get to find out! I just had to be close enough so that my super cool mind reading power could work. Slyly, I stood on the bench outside of the locker room, with my brain close to the wall so that a real connection could occur. BAZINGA! Power literally spewed out of my ears into the wall. “Damn that Dalia girl sure is a babe.” Ugh, I was so upset. (Dalia is my biggest enemy) Well that was upsetting, but what I really wanted to know was what Jeffrey had to say about me. I waited for another 20 minutes, but my name just didn’t come up. So, I decided to take action. I figured, if I walked into the room “accidently” they would HAVE to think about me. I took a nice little stroll into the boys’ locker room, where I found every football player half dressed sipping Gatorade and texting their baes. Jaws dropped. I’d like to think it was because they were amazed by my good looks and smoking bod, but none of the above is true, so I figure it’s becauase I am a girl who just walked into a strictly boys zone. It interrupts every girl/guy code. Hehe oops. Since no one was saying anything, and I was too distracted to connect my super spy mindreading powers, I left. “Lily this Lily that Lily blah blah blah” My plan was genius. My name was everywhere. Even Jeffrey was talking about me. My mind reading power caught him saying something I will never forget, “I wish Lily Powers would hit me up on tinder!” I’ve never smiled so hard in my life. In fact, my lips were so chapped I began to bleed. "
44,"There was once an unusual event that happened in the city of Ivanhoe. The day started off gloomy with a lot of rain clouds and a high chance of rain, but for this one particular boy it was as if he was being reborn. This feeling came to be because the day before while he was at school playing with his friends and one of his friends gave a juice box, however, this was not any ordinary juice box. Little did this little boy, named Stone, know about what this juice box contained. Stone drank it with much appreciation and thirst. Before he fell asleep that night he started feeling a little funny, as if he were growing more strength throughout his body. When he woke up the next morning he started off to school the next day and suddenly started running unrealistically fast, he gave a great leap and realized that he could jump over extremely high buildings and once he landed he created some sort of creator on the ground, making him realize he has the superpower of jumping really and being supernaturally strong. He started exploring the extent of his superpowers and as he was growing he started to become a hero. He would help the authority catch all the criminals with his extreme speed, strength, and jumping ability. Soon the city of Ivanhoe solely relied on the help of Stone. He was a true superhero that helped its citizens and Ivanhoe PD. Stone never came around to realize that the cause of all of this was the unordinary juice box his friend gave him thousands of years ago. Stone lived on to continue fighting crime and helping its citizens be as safe as can be. I know this because I am Stone."
45,"Up until now, Jennifer had no idea what it was. She always knew the male voice inside her head was unusual. She thought maybe it was her subconscious talking to her as a male or maybe she had some type of psychological issue. She thought she was crazy. But it was in that moment, sitting across from a guy about her age on the train, that she realized, she was reading someone’s mind all along. And it was his. 
“She’s beautiful,” the mysterious boy thought, “She has amazing eyes.” She could read every thought that went through his mind. This is insane, Jennifer thought. She couldn’t begin to fathom what was going on. All her life, she always pondered what the strange voice in her head was. Looking at him, she now knew that it was this guy all along. Too afraid to look up at him, Jennifer continued to look down, her eyes plastered to her hands in her lap and mind running rampant. 
“C’mon Andrew. Talk to her,” he was silently screaming to himself. His name’s Andrew. Jennifer found some relief in knowing at least one thing about this guy she had no idea was such a huge part of her life. I can read minds. Well, his mind at least. She was in disbelief. Hm, he thinks I’m beautiful. She smiled at this, realizing that she returns the feeling. "
46,"On what seemed like a regular Thursday morning, Auden rolled out of bed to get ready for her 8 a.m. class. Like every other morning, she showered, did her hair, make up, and brushed her teeth. Everything seemed normal. That is until she went to ride her bike. 
Like everything else that morning, everything seemed very ordinary. Auden had been used to the schedule and everything seemed extremely mundane. That was until she started riding her bike. Going down the bike path she takes every day, she sees a boy riding his bike with no hands. Because of Auden’s lack of balance, she was never able to ride without holding on to her handle bars. Except something changed that morning.
 After seeing the boy riding without holding the handle bars, Auden felt a sudden rush of confidence. Her right hand let go of her handle bars, and it seemed effortless for her to ride her bike. Surprised by her own abilities, she decided to try letting go of her other hand. She was able to balance perfectly and ride her bike without holding the handle bars. She was shocked by her own abilities. 
As the day went by, she found herself trying things she’s never thought of before. She met up with her friends on the cheer team on the lawn outside they gym. They were going over their routine, Auden watched carefully as her friends completed the jumps and flips. Something strange came over Auden, and she decided that she wanted to try the routine. Her friends scoffed at her, remembering that she can’t even walk without tripping over her own feet. But Auden felt a confidence inside of her that she’s never felt before, and told them that she believes she can do it. Her friends, looking concerned, agreed and told her they’d help her. Auden declined. 
To the surprise of her friends (and herself), Auden was able to perform the routine seamlessly. After all the flips and tricks, her friends were speechless to what she had just done. Auden suddenly was aware of what was happening – she had developed the power to do whatever action she sees. With this new awareness, she embarked on a day’s adventure of trying new things. 
Auden was all over the place that day. She watched the basketball team at one of their games and saw a guy dunk. After the game, she asked to see the ball and dunked herself. Everyone was impressed. Then, she went out to the beach and watched surfer take on giant swells. Though she had never been on a board before, she asked one of her friends if she could borrow theirs and headed out toward the water. She handled herself in the water like she had been surfing for years. 
This power of Auden’s lead her to do some great things, and everyone was extremely impressed. They knew her as the girl that could do anything. She was asked to be on every sports team, be in every club, and offered every job. Her life seemed perfect. That was until she was faced with a task that no one has ever showed her before. 
At her job, she was required to use Excel. Thinking that it was such a simple task, she told her boss that she didn’t need any help. Then she tried to start working and realized she didn’t know how to use Excel. At all. She spiraled into a pit of despair because she was so used to being the perfect person who could do nearly anything. This caused her to become recluse and hide away from society because she was so ashamed. Unfortunately for her, her power caused her hubris and she wasted away by herself for the rest of her life. "
47,"It was late. The sun went down, the tide went up. Lisa couldn’t stop shaking. 
“You haven’t been yourself these past few days… not since your trip to the Bahamas”, said Marcus. 
“Just mind your own business, Marcus”, snapped Lisa.
Indeed, she hasn’t been herself, and Lisa knew this. It was a cold night, full of fun and games, in the company of good friends. Lisa was at a bar, when she couldn’t help but notice a faint light coming from one of the distant islands. 
“You see that light?” Lisa asked.
Everyone was too loud or drunk to answer her. 
For some odd reason, Lisa found the will in herself to take the next ferry out to that island. As Lisa approached the hilly island, the light became brighter and stronger. Lisa raised an eyebrow, knowing something was happening. After making her way through the rough terrain, she stumbled upon what looked to be an orb. For a second, Lisa thought she was too drunk and was imagining this. As she went out to touch it, the orb struck her arm, and she passed out. 
When she woke up, it was daylight. No birds were chirping, no cars, no waves, no anything. Once Lisa got up, she knew something was different. The entire ocean stopped moving. The flag on the mainland just stood there, in mid-wave. Everything looked as if it were frozen… in time. Lisa was not. 
“Holy shit” Lisa exclaimed. “This has to be a dream.”
Lisa walked out into the water, and put her foot into the ocean. The water was still water, but Lisa could stand on it. She made her way into the island, pacing past the ferry stopped in time. When she got to the port, she stared at the clock on the board. It was 8:00 AM, and a Monday morning. She didn’t know that it has been 8 AM on a Monday morning… for the past 4 days. 
At this point, Lisa knew something was happening. Whether it was her, or the world around her, she could not tell. She moved around all the people in mid stride; men, women, and children, rushing to get somewhere, and here she was. Lisa could move in time, while everyone and everything else around her stopped. 
As she continued along the station, she felt a jingling in her pocket. She looked down, and pulled out a watch. A stopwatch, actually."
48," Layla was your average high school girl. She was smart, but not a genius. She like to swim, but she never considered herself an athlete. She wasn’t particularly creative in any way. In other words she was just like you and me. 
One day after swimming practice, Layla stayed a bit longer than the rest of her team mates to work on the time it took to complete a lap. 
She felt angry at herself for being unable to beat her time. This only proved to herself that all she really was, is a normal girl. 
It had only been twenty minutes since the rest of the swim team had left when Layla noticed the sky turning grey above her. 
She decided it was time to go home since she didn’t want to get caught in the rain. 
Just as Layla was about to step out of the pool a giant snow ball fell out of the sky, frightening Layla and leaving her confused. A second later another one landed a few feet away from her and then another one and then another. They started to get bigger and when one of them nearly missed her faced she decided things were getting dangerous and that it was about time she go into the locker room.
Right as she was going to step in a lightning bolt shot from the sky blowing Layla off her feet. Then the lightning stopped. She couldn’t believe what had happened. It was crazy and she knew that no one would believe her. So she kept it to herself.
As she was walking home she reminded herself of her inability to become a faster swimmer. At this point she didn’t feel angry at herself but sad. At this very, moment rain started pouring from the sky.
Layla was still sad and the rain was still pouring, but as she approached her house she noticed something strange. That when she heard her dog running towards her and that her feelings of sadness were replaced by happiness the rain cleared and that a rainbow was now visible in the sky.
Layla brushed it off as mere coincidence but after several instance similar to those the day after practice she knew she had a gained a strange gift. Layla’s emotions had somehow become powerful enough to control the weather. "
49,"For many people, life is full of struggles and hardships. Everyone has had a bad day or a bad week where they just feel like nothing is going right and the end of this pain is nowhere in sight. For Claire, this was never the case, she always looked at the world as a new and inspiring place every day. She found gratitude in all the tasks put in front of her and always saw the positive side in any situation. One day she met a man who had just lost his wife to cancer and in turn lost his home because of the growing medical bills from his wife’s sickness. Claire felt so sorry for this man and for a split second she had one of those “That so Raven” moments where she could see the future of this mans life: it was pretty bleak, his children grew up hating him for never having enough money, he never married again and died young from a heart problem. Claire saw this future and decided it wasn’t good enough, so she imagined him getting a promotion at work and the bank deciding to return his home to him without any penalties. She told the man about the future she envisioned for him and he laughed in disbelief, believing that Claire was just some nut job with no sense of reality. The next day Claire was walking down the street and sure enough the man was standing on the corner they had met at the day before. He approached her with a giddy look in his eye, he gave Claire a big hug and his eyes began to well up with tears as he expressed his happiness with how life has turned around in one day. He said everything Claire had predicted had come true and he couldn’t be more grateful. Claire was a little confused, how could she have made his fate change? She had a strange feeling she understood what was happening, she could make peoples lives better just by thinking about it. After the man released Claire from his tight hug, she excused herself graciously and continued down the street. “If this really is some sort of super power” Claire thought “then it should work on anyone right?” As she kept walking she saw a horrific car crash occur in the street next to her. Claire rushed over to see what had happened. A man had hit a biker with his car and had stopped to call an ambulance. Claire bent down over the biker, a young college student, and saw how this scene would end: the biker would be taken to the hospital but the wounds she sustained on her legs would never allow her to walk again. Claire wanted to help this poor girl so badly but for some reason it seemed her power wasn’t working. Claire felt so terrible she accompanied the young woman to the hospital where the doctors gave her the horrible news she had predicted. Claire sat in the room with the biker and just in that moment she saw another future for this young girl: she could walk again and even received a new bike and helmet from the driver of the car that hit her as consolation. Claire wasn’t sure if this power would really work but she hoped it would and gave the biker her number to call her if she needed anything. A few days later she received a call from the biker with miraculous news that she could indeed walk again and that she had gotten a new bike and helmet from the driver that hit her. Claire gasped in disbelief and realized she could create miracles. After a brief moment of joy and awe Claire had a sinking feeling that a gift like this does not come without its responsibilities. Who needs miracles the most? Who should decide who deserves them and who doesn’t? Where did this gift come from and how is it supposed to be used? "
50,"He woke up sweating, confused and paranoid. He’s gone through this before but something felt a little different this time. Mike hopped out of bed and jumped in the shower, still feeling a little groggy from partying the night before. Was it just a case of the flu?  It couldn’t be, nope, it wasn’t really a sick feeling. Then there, right in the middle of his shower it hit him. The memories of last night hit him in a rush. He remembered taking an uber home after a night of some heavy drinking. Mike’s a depressed drunk and the driver wasn’t having it. After depressing him with his talking, the driver pulled up to an alley and got out of the car. Mike was freaking out but so gone he couldn’t do anything about it. The driver came in the back seat of the car and sat next to him. He pulled out a syringe and told him, “I can tell you’ve got some issues, I think you deserve this,” right before plunging it right in his vein. He doesn’t remember what he felt after that but goes to doctor to get checked out. As he leaves his house he hears all these voices. Nobody’s talking but as he walks by people he hears them saying depressing things. It finally hit him, the driver gave him the power to read minds of other depressed people. The man was tired of Mikes whining and wanted him to see what it’s like dealing with the depressed venting of strangers. Mike took advantage of this newfound power and became a psychiatrist, helping people as he knew what they were truly going through. The constant barrage of depressing thoughts intruding upon his conscious led to him outgrowing his own depression. He realized that everyone goes through their own personal struggles and with the right help everyone could be saved."
51,"Have you ever wished that you could read someone’s mind? Maybe your significant other is acting strange and you can’t put your finger on it but you know something is up. Or is it best to be left in the dark about somethings because knowing too much could do more harm than good? If you ask Kat, the less you know, the better. 
Kat is unique and has the ability to read minds. She received this gift (or curse) on her 18th birthday. She doesn’t know how she got it, all she knows is that when she blew out her candles she could hear judgmental voices in her head. “Did she really just spit on cake as she was blowing her candle out?” “Kat just made the weirdest face trying to blow those candles out” “I wonder what kind of cake it is” “I think she’s unhappy because she wishes her boyfriend could be here”. She looked around in awe but did not say anything. Was she really hearing everyone’s thoughts or was she going crazy? Searching for answers she looks at her mother and asked her, “What are you thinking right now?” Her mother replies back, “That you made the weirdest face trying to blow out all 18 candles.”
That was just the start of it, imagine hearing everyone’s thoughts about you. Completely uncensored and unfiltered, the good and the bad. Would that drive you mad? In Kat’s case, it did just that. She knew what people were saying about her, that she had gained some weight. But she couldn’t help it, cheer season was over and she wasn’t working out as much anymore. She thought she gained a little bit of weight but it was apparent that everyone knew she gained weight, and in their eyes it wasn’t just a little. She heard every hurtful criticism people were thinking and it drove her mad. She eventually stopped eating in public and only ate in the privacy of her own room in front of a mirror where she could monitor how much she ate. When she started losing weight she heard all the positive feedback and it encouraged her to keep it up. She then started to eat and "
52,"I walked through the streets, feeling the eyes of the world on me.
Did they know where I came from? Do they know what I’m about to do?
I walked into a nearby store, looking around for the bathroom and quickly rushed in, locking the door behind me. I looked in the mirror and just stared at my reflection, making note of everything about me that was still the same. I still had the same dull black hair, the same shiny brown eyes, crooked nose and small, plump lips. 
I was still the same person, only with a possibly supernatural ability. 
I paced around the bathroom, wondering about how I was going to test this ability and whether or not I was insane for even thinking this was possible. 
No one can do this. You aren’t some sort of mutant. It won’t work.
But I had to try. 
I closed my eyes and tried to replicate the feeling I had only a few hours ago. I concentrated on my breathing, trying to calm it down and imagined a place in my mind. I imagined New York City, where my family was. I imagined being in Time’s square in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. I imagined shopping and the people who were all around. 
Soon the noises of honking cars and construction filled my ears, almost as if I was really there. I smiled as I felt the familiarity of the scene, but was knocked out of my imagination when I felt a large force push against my back and I ended up on my knees. I opened my eyes and saw the black asphalt beneath me; felt the roughness against my hands and my knees and my heart raced. 
I thought it was impossible
I looked up and sure enough I was in the middle of the square, Broadway signs all around me, screens of events and people and ads shining brightly and stores four stories high glaring down at me from my position on the dirty ground. 
“Are you alright?” 
I looked up and saw an older woman kneeling in front of me. I smiled at her and quickly propped myself up onto my feet, thanking her for her concern. She walked off and I marveled at where I was. I was home and all I had to do was imagine it and feel the place rush through me and I could be there, anywhere. This new found transportation ability was everything I dreamed of and I was excited to test it out some more, but first I had to see my family again. 
I thought about calling for a cab, but then where would be the fun in that? I found a bathroom again and once again I closed my eyes and imagined my bedroom. 
The sounds around me disappeared and I felt myself being embraced by soft sheets and a comfortable bed.  I was home. "
53,"It was at this point that Jimmy realized what his new powers let him do. When its test time, he can close his eye and as he thinks about the question, he visualizes his teacher talking about it during lecture. It’s almost as if his eyes can accurately record entire lectures word by word, and also any notes written on the board. Any time Jimmy doesn’t feel confident with his knowledge on a question, he simply closes his eyes and like magic he sees his professor explaining the exact answer to his question. Jimmy is both happy and troubled by his new powers. He is happy because he feels like this will be a great tool for him now and in the future, but troubled at the same time because he doesn’t know whether he should tell his friends or family. He ponders, “Will my friends be jealous that I get good grades without trying?” and “if I tell people, will the news make it around to administration, causing negative consequences for me?” As he wondered about his possibilities, without thinking; he stands up to hand in his test…he looks down because he doesn’t even remember getting past the first page but is surprised to see all the correct answers bubbled in. He knows what his powers do, but not sure of how in control of them he is."
54,One day a guy found out he had super powers. This was a huge deal for him. His super power could change the world. His super power was that he knew when someone was in danger before it happened and he could go prevent it from happening. He saved and protected many lives due to this super power. He was very grateful for this super power. He lived in a very big city so his power benefitted several people. The local police hired him to help them keep the city safe. Everyone was very thankful for his help. He helped make the crime rate go down tremendously. This guy was considered a hero and was loved among everyone in the community. 
55,"That morning, when I realized who I had become, began like any other. I woke up, poured myself a cup of decent coffee from the pot that was likely brewed hours earlier by one of my early-worm house-mates, and sat in a chair on my balcony. Mornings had always been my time to glance out at the ocean, appreciate life and bask in a few minutes of solitude before my day began. Although, after a few moments of silence, I caught a glimpse of a bird. Something about the way it could fly freely, without any responsibility, caused me to daydream so intensely that I slipped into some sort of a trance—or so it seemed. I forgot where I was and, for a moment, who I was. I imagined opening my arms and leaping off the balcony, only to dive down and dip back up into flight. When I shuttered myself back into reality, I realized that my daydream was no dream at all. I had actually begun to fly. I didn’t allow confusion or terror to consume, instead I just flew. I lost myself in the cool air that brushed my hair behind my head and tickled my skin. It felt as if, for the first time, I could actually breathe. After hours of wandering from my birds-eye view, I returned home. Would I choose to tell my friends? In movies it always seemed as though the best option was to conceal your special identity from the world. I wouldn’t want to become some sort of test subject of the government, questioned and probed for the duration of my life. Although, something particular was bothering me. I had no idea why this happened to me. I hadn’t come in contact with some sort radioactive sludge, or kidnapped by an evil scientist (as far as I knew).  I started to wonder whether this was genetic, or perhaps possibly life-threatening. I had only one option. Never tell.  "
56,"Once upon a time there was a boy named Freddy. Freddy was a very normal, average 14 year old boy. He had braces, sometimes forgot to wear deodorant, and had a typical crush on the pretty girl at school Mindy that didn’t like him back. One day, he was walking home from school. Freddy, who tended to be quite clumsy, tripped on a crack on the sidewalk. He felt a magnetic pull, hit the ground with his braces, and felt a shock go through his body. He felt that it was pretty weird but assumed he had just imagined it. 
When Freddy got up, he began to continue walking home from school. He didn’t usually look at his feet (perhaps that’s why he was so clumsy), but when he got home he stopped before his front door to wipe his shoes off on the door mat. When he looked down to wipe his shoes, he noticed that his shoes were different. He was wearing Yeezy’s now. “What happened to by New Balance sneakers??” Freddy seemed to yell in his mind. He suspiciously walked into his house. Everything else seemed normal. He ran back to his room without greeting his mom in the living room. 
As he creaked the door open, what he saw made him jump back a little. His whole room was different! His bedspread, walls, everything. Before that day, Freddy had only one mirror in his room that he had to stand on his bed to see his face in (Freddy was very short). Now, as Freddy slammed his door and laid his back onto it in fear, he felt that he had a full length mirror on the back of his door. He was afraid to look at himself, but he turned around anyway. When he looked at the mirror he saw a tall, handsome, stylish man. He had on a long, wide-necked shirt underneath a bomber jacket. AND NO BRACES! Freddy’s teeth were perfectly straight. Now, Freddy thought, he had the power to be popular in his eighth grade class. That’s when he noticed a framed picture on his bedside table. He and Mindy…he had his arm around her! Freddy’s mom interrupted his thoughts, “Fred! Why are you home so early? Was basketball practice cancelled?”
Basketball? Fred? What was going on? He opened the door and said, “Oh, mom, I must have forgotten about practice.” 
“You never miss practice. Come on, I’ll drive you.”
As they arrived at Freddy’s school for practice, he was freaking out. But he walked into the gym and suddenly everybody seemed to be praising him. “There he is! Fred, our star player!” Star player… Freddy liked the sound of that. 
The next day at school, Freddy found that he no longer had to sit alone at lunch. He sat with the basketball guys and the cheerleaders, one of them being Mindy. Wow, Freddy thought, I really do have power here now. He never wanted to go back to his old clumsy self. "
57,"Usually when we sleep at night, we dream. Some people have the ability to not only dream at night, but throughout the day too. We dream different things, from what is stressing us out, to what we hope to achieve, and what seems impossible to us.  What if your dreams actually became a reality? If someone gave you the opportunity to bring them to life, would you? Here is my answer: no. I once heard a story about a kid who got stuck in his dream because he wanted nothing more than to make it real. It all started with him searching and experimenting different ways on how to make it happen. He tried everything from taking drugs before going to bed, trying to stay awake while still trying to sleep, but nothing worked, until one day something did. His day started off with normal things like seeing the people he knew, doing daily activities, and going about his every day ritual. When it got darker, he decided it was time to go to sleep. "

59,"It was an ordinary Wednesday afternoon for Timmy. He had just gotten out of school and was walking home alone, as usual, trying to avoid the boys walking across the street from him. These boys always picked on Timmy, and were much larger than him, but he had learned a new path to get home that the boys had yet to follow him on. He would usually turn down an alley just as the boys did their usual bashing on one kid, Edgar, just before he reached home, to ensure no one was paying attention to him. Today, however, Edgar didn’t show up to school and there was nothing distracting the boys when Timmy came upon the usual alley. Not knowing what to do, Timmy booked it down the alley in hopes that the boys wouldn’t find him. Just as he made a turn, out of the alley onto the street two blocks from his house, he stopped running and listened for footsteps. He heard nothing and continued on his way home.
As he came up to his next turn, he was suddenly stopped by the boys. He didn’t know what else to do, so he turned around and immediately started running back towards the alley. He knew he wasn’t any faster than the other boys, and he could hear them all catching up to him. As he turned back down the alley, he suddenly felt a rush through his body. Not knowing what was going on, and not being able to focus on anything but getting away, Timmy ignored the feeling and kept running as fast as he possibly could. Moments later, his pace sped up and Timmy couldn’t believe how fast he was running. He had already lost the boys and was less than a block away from home. He was passing all of the cars on the road, and he felt no sort of exhaustion. When he realized he was out of sight of the boys, he stopped and looked down at his feet. His shoes were worn down and you could see his socks through the bottom, but that was the only thing worn out, his feet and legs and lungs were, to his surprise, not even close to being exhausted. 
He decided not to tell anyone what had happened and do a little research for himself. After searching for hours on his computer, he couldn’t find anything about “super fast running” or “sudden adrenaline rush creates super speed”. As the next two days passed on, Timmy was able to avoid the boys and go about normally, just awaiting the weekend when he could go out to an old abandoned track and see if he could repeat what had happened on Wednesday.
Saturday morning came and he woke up at the crack of dawn, showered and ate breakfast and headed straight to the track. He began running at his usual slow pace, nothing had changed about his typical jog. But as he tried to increase his pace, nothing happened and he became intensely exhausted. He didn’t understand what was wrong. He went back home and decided to try again later. 
After resting for a few hours, Timmy returned to the track, but this time the boys were there playing football in the middle field. He turned around and headed home, hoping they hadn’t spotted him, but he heard the thundering footsteps and began running, this time faster than earlier. Suddenly, he was running just as fast, if not, even faster than he had been on Wednesday. When he returned home, he realized that his adrenaline is what made his quick feet work and something had to trigger him in order for him to run fast. The next day he began finding things that would trigger his adrenaline other than the boys. "
60,"Jed had been waiting for this day his entire life. His twenty first birthday had arrived and he would finally be able be able to use his real ID at the bars tonight with all his closest friends! Jed had always possessed a strange relationship with alcohol: he noticed that whenever he would drink at house parties, he always felt unique urges to go for walks, play Frisbee, and thoroughly enjoy his favorite steak dish – right down to sucking on the bone - at the local grill. He felt these urges frequently when he drank and without fail. Yet, when he told his friends about these drunk inclinations, many of them responded with laughter, claiming that they all had their “quirks.” 
Night fell soon enough and the bar scene was wild. After many drinks, the birthday boy felt his familiar inclinations, yet this time, there was something more. While socializing with friends, he began to notice increased hair on his body. A rubbery surface emerged on his paw. He began peeing all over the room! He had transformed into a dog!"
61,"As he stood on top of the Empire State Building, Mike began to wonder where he would be standing if he had never woke up on February 3rd, 2016 with the powers he currently found himself with; that power was the power to control every molecule in his body. This allowed him to expand, shrink, fly, manage his super strength, and that was just the beginning of it.  Truth was that it had only been 3 weeks since his blessing and yet, he was not aware about how he obtained such insane powers. 
On the morning of February 3rd, Mike carried out his daily routine. He got out of his twin extra-large mattress, stared out the window for ten minutes, showered, dressed, and had breakfast. As he had breakfast, Mike turned on his television to realize that the regularly morning news channel was not on; instead, it was Sesame Street. After a few minutes of wondering why the news was not on it struck him; daylight savings affected the time and took an hour off the day, and now he was late for work. Leaving his breakfast on the table and his television on, Mike ran for his suitcase, and ran for the bus stop only to wait for thirty minutes to realize that it was not coming anytime soon. He ran as fast as he could to work, a four mile distance, until he was hit car a car as he ran across the street. Rather than he getting pulverized, the front of the minivan was demolished, and not a single scratch was left on him. Panicked and scared, Mike ran to an alley only to realize yet another strange thing; his heart rate was normal. He decided to call into the laboratory and call in sick for the day and returned home. This was the beginning of a new life for Mike.
Day by day, he learned something new about his powers. He learned he can expand by reaching for a remote that was too far away. He learned that he had incredible strength by going to the gym and 
As a scientist, Mike understood that he could never live a life in secrecy and become a vigilante and save the world as they do in the movies. He knew that was all fictional. People become aware of these type of things very quickly and once they do, things turn for the worst. As a result, Mike decided to work for science as a lab rat so that scientists can attempt to figure out why this happened to him, and if he can use it for good causes other than being a vigilante. This was where he learned that he has the ability to control the molecules and cells in his body for his own benefit. Although he became the test subject when he was once the observer, Mike knew his interests lied in what was best for the world. Such power is not meant to be harvested in privacy and utilized for personal gain. On the contrary, Mike understood that with great power comes great responsibility (he understood that from Spiderman), but he became something better than Spiderman; he became a man of honesty and integrity."
62,"Diana was walking along the sidewalk, just like any normal day. Walking to school was an everyday thing for her, something that she did quite often when her mom went off to work earlier than normal. Typical doctor things, her mother would say to her, and nothing that you should concern yourself about too much. So Diana hardly ever questioned it, thinking it away as it being a work related thing. The one thing that she did look forward to was meeting her best friend Isabel on the way. 
Diana had first met Isabel when she moved from Boston to this small town of Fresno and she sat next to her in English. Both immediately hit it off, expressing their weird love for Shakespeare that no one else could ever understand. And from that moment, they became best friends. To Diana, Shakespeare gave her an escape from her normal boring life and inspired her to write her own short stories, mainly about the dreams that she would have throughout the day. Everything from her prince on a white horse to a ghost chasing her down the hallway, she wrote it out into her daily diary which now was a collection of all of her short stories (or dreams). 
This particular day, Diana had a feeling that something new was going to come to her. It was a nagging feel deep in her heart, something she hadn’t felt before. Something that told her a new experience was coming her way. So she took the diary along with her. 
“What’s that thing you’re carrying around”, Isabel asked. Isabel knew almost everything about Diana. Everything except for the diary. “Oh nothing big. Just a new notebook for school that I grabbed from my room before I left. Didn’t have the time to put it in my backpack so I just held it.” Diana tried to steer her conversation away from her secret diary and distracted Isabel by asking her about typical boy things, stuff that Isabel could go on and on about. 
While Isabel was talking away, Diana saw something from the corner of her eye which caught her attention. She had never seen it before, so it creeped her out when she did notice it. To her, it seemed like the garden gnome from Mrs. Stevenson’s garden was following her with her eyes. “Diana! What are you doing?” Diana looks up and sees Isabel was quite a way ahead of her, with a questioning look. She didn’t realize that she stopped and was fully staring back at the garden gnome, which she still felt was staring back at her. “Nothing. I just never noticed that weird looking gnome before. Have you?” Isabel responded,” No but seems typical of Mrs. Stevenson to get something new to attract more attention to her garden. You already know how competitive she is with the neighborhood garden award.” 
As they both were walking away, with Isabel continuing her story about some new guy she found, Diana turned and looked back at the gnome.
This time it was staring right at her.
Sitting in English, she sat all the way in the back, which was unusual for her since she sat in the front since day 1. No one seemed to notice or care, so she opened her diary and wrote about a daydream she had about the gnome in Biology. It was about the gnome suddenly coming to life and taking over the neighborhood, eventually taking over the town. As she flipped through her past stories, her eyes caught something that she didn’t remember writing down but was clearly written in her handwriting. 
Turning back to the page and looking through each, she found it. The word “gnome” was staring at her. Just like the gnome in the garden. As she started reading her passage for that particular day, her blood ran cold. 
In that entry, she wrote about that specific gnome and how she felt its eyes following her. Every single detail in that entry matched up with what happened on her way to school with Isabel. Even what Isabel said to her. ‘I don’t ever remember writing this’, she thought to herself. As she started flipping through other past entries, she noticed that each one matched up with something that happened to her sometime in her past, but none she remembered writing. 
Then she looked at the particular entry that she had just wrote. “The gnome came to life.”
She had made a mistake."
63,"Janice looked up at her boss, blearily wondering why she had stayed up until 3 AM last night finishing season 4 of Archer. Her gaze wandered to her boss’s frantically moving lips, then to his eyebrows, and finally settled on a pimple on the tip of his nose. She almost smiled at the sight of the unhappy-looking zit but caught herself just in time, and was brought out of her reverie by a brief pause in his incessant chattering.
“Oh yes, I totally understand and I swear it will never happen again,” she offered, hoping it made sense in context but really deeply wishing that the interaction would be over so she could go back to browsing Facebook. Unfortunately for her, Janice’s boss took the opportunity to launch off on yet another of his all-too-common tirades.
“That’s all well and good, but you see, this company is a well-oiled blah blah blah unified workplace blah blah…” Janice’s attention wandered as soon as her boss went into his “well-oiled machine” speech, and she wanted more than anything for him to just
“SHUT UP ALREADY!” she blurted out. To her utmost shock, he complied. The awkward silence stretched for 5 seconds, then 10, and by the time half a minute had gone by with the boss remaining silent but turning increasingly deep shades of purple, Janice began to realize something very strange had happened. Her boss never shut up. In fact, he had probably never been told to shut up before as even getting a single word in edgewise during one of his frequent rants was nearly impossible. 
“Um…I mean…sorry,” she stammered out, but was met by continued silence, although her boss’s prominent forehead vein was by this time dangerously close to rupturing. 
“Um…go ahead?” she said, and all of a sudden a thunderous stream of sulfurous curses began spewing out of her boss’s mouth.
“WHAT THE **** DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME? YOU, TELL ME TO SHUT UP? WHY YOU LITTLE INSUBORDINATE SON OF A—“ was what he got out before Janice, having a sudden inkling, replied in a measured tone, “No, you shut up.” And so it was. Her boss shut up. The sudden silence in the room was music to Janice’s ears, as she began to grasp the implications of this newfound ability. 
Janice was the quiet, meek sort, the rare kind of person who had managed to go her entire life without uttering such a rude command as “shut up.”  Now that she knew that no one had the ability to resist her when she told them to do so, she knew she would never have to suffer listening to an intolerable asshole ever again. In fact, now that she thought of that…

64,"Madison is a first year college student who wants to make a difference in the world. She is smart, motivated, and extremely selfless and she wants to fix the mess that the human race has created on this planet. She devotes almost all of her time and energy trying to create social and environmental change. But Madison has one huge obstacle preventing her from achieving this goal. Whenever she tries to convince people to help create this change, whether it be politicians or ordinary people, no one gives her the time of day. No one listens when she tries to educate them or show them how they can make a difference; everyone is “too busy.” One day, while standing in front of a grocery store asking people to sign a petition, a man walks by. Madison says “hello” and starts to introduce the petition but the man doesn’t care and continues walking. A frustrated Madison mumbles to herself, “Can you please come back and give me a second of your time?” As if by magic, the man stops in his place, turns around and says, “Actually, I would love to hear about your petition!” Madison is shocked but explains the petition and gets the man’s signature. For the rest of the day she mumbles the same thing after every rejection and, each time, the person changes their mind and comes back and signs her petition. Madison is beyond ecstatic but is convinced that each time was a coincidence. The next week, she sets up a meeting to talk to the chancellor of her university about making the school more environmentally friendly. After almost an hour of the chancellor Madison’s ideas are unrealistic, Madison uses that same strategy and mumbles, “I really think you should reconsider.” Just like that, the Chancellor says, “you know what? Let’s do it. We’ll start with conserving more water in the bathrooms!”

In this world all the 18-25 year olds have to battle one another plus the beasts to earn the right to go against the alien invaders that has caused them to do so in order to be able to fight the true chosen one of earth. It’s a given that Tom will but the journey of the tourney isn’t that simple. It’s harsh and will take a lot for Tom to end up succeeding. The way the battles take place is every day you are randomly assigned a list of people you can battle normally its 10 or so. The thing is though you have no idea who they are, you kind of do but not to the point where everyone has an advantage. Time is “frozen” so it goes on day by day but not to the point it’ll be years later to finish this gigantic battle and once you get defeated you don’t die. However these battles are intense Tom can equip himself with basic tools; knife, bow and arrow, even some guns but besides that their no huge military him or anyone else can have. It’s more of a skill vs skill type of battle. Tom has to fight people from his hometown of Brentwood, CA. He wants to prove to others he is the chosen one and even though it can be anyone he tries his luck. It’s interesting because the day can be so normal, but with these fights going on and people don’t necessarily work because of this time freeze the other people just watch. Since they are either too old or too young to participate the weapon the participants use can’t hurt them or get in there way so it’s as if the other people not playing are ghost. Which is a good thing so others won’t get hurt but can still watch the mayhem. As the first few opponents have gone up against Tom and lost it has been a thriller actions. Some people have been close to winning against Tom, but not close enough. They tension rises as they see how many people are still in this type of worldwide game of elimination. Toms biggest battles are of his old school friends which he has nothing against, but will still want to win. In a fight against some former athlete’s things get good because they use their abilities as a type of “super power” which it’s not but it helps. Like football and baseball players have that extra strength while runners and soccer players have that cardio."
66,"Arthur usually sits in class, gazing around, never having interest in any one object or person. His eyes are always wondering looking for the next best thing. He hardly pays attention to what the teacher is saying and hardly notices who is sitting to the left or right of him. Generally, Arthur struggles to connect to people or ideas in his daily life. He goes through the same old routine every day, wishing something interesting might eventually strike him. He has wished this for a long time, and nothing had ever changed for him, until the day he found the emerald rock.
One day, Arthur was walking home like he does every day, but that day was a little different. Like mentioned before, Arthur is usually unaware and uninterested in his surroundings. But a flicker of light struck his eye right before he got to his house. On the ground, in the midst of many rocks and leaves, Arthur spotted an emerald rock. Normally, he might look past this seemingly average emerald rock, but Arthur was somehow drawn to this rock. He decided to call it his lucky rock, and vowed to always have it in his pocket wherever he went. Arthur was hoping that this rock could be something superstitious for him, bringing him a more vibrant, lucky, interesting life. 
The day after he found the rock, Arthur went to school just like it was any other day. But in class, he felt a little bit different, a little more excited to be where he was. For once, he was content in the present moment. It wasn’t a big change at first. He was just slightly more interested in the topic of discussion of class. And he finally noticed that there was a girl to his left and a boy to his right. He was slowly starting to become more in tune with his surroundings. While Arthur wasn’t aware of these subtle changes, he did feel a little more positive leaving school that day. But after class was over, he walked home just like every other day and continued to keep the emerald rock in his possession. About a week of school went by where Arthur continued to feel a little more connected with his surroundings, and the people in his environment. It wasn’t until the Monday after a long weekend where Arthur finally new his life had changed forever.
Arthur was in class, the same one as always, but instead of it being a generally quiet, peaceful environment, he started to hear voices. Voices everywhere. Voices coming from the left, the right, in front of him, and even behind. He couldn’t seem to turn off all of this noise and didn’t know how to shut it off. Because no one was talking. No one was talking but Arthur knew what everyone was thinking. Without even understanding the extent of this change just yet, Arthur started to hone in on his new power. He first targeted the teacher, quieting the rest of the voices, getting to know what she was really thinking about while she talked about algebra. Then he tuned into the girl on his left, the one thinking about the conversation she had with her parents before school. And then the boy to the right, who was planning out an excuse to get out of class early. 
Arthur didn’t know what exactly was going on, but he was excited about it. Excited that he finally noticed the girl to the left, the boy to his right, and finally knew the subject of the class he was taking. Arthur finally cared about the people in his surroundings. He finally found a way to connect. And while Arthur would never understand the extent of his newfound ability, he did know that his life did just get a little more interesting. "
67,"Tanya was sitting in class when she first heard it. She looked up from her notes, startled. No one else except the professor was talking, so why did she hear someone else’s voice? She looked over to the boy sitting next to her. He was dozing off, so that meant that he wasn’t the one talking. Plus it was a girls’ voice in her head so it couldn’t have been him talking. She looked to her left and focused on the girl. “God he is such an asshole. I’m literally going to break up with him first thing when I see him. How can I put up with this all the time? Ok, pay attention. We have a midterm tomorrow. Maybe I can break up with him after the midterm so I’m not so stressed out about it.” Tanya’s eyes widened. The girl wasn’t saying anything. So how could she hear what she was saying? What is going on? She decided to just relax and pointed her attention to her professor. As she looked at him, she heard more voices in her head, this time in his voice. “These kids better be paying attention because this is definitely going to be on the midterm. God that boy is so blatantly sleeping. I definitely don’t get paid enough for this.” Tanya jumped in her seat. Her professor definitely wasn’t saying what she just heard. What was happening? She nervously looked down at her notebook and scribbled down her notes. As long as she didn’t concentrate on anyone she wouldn’t be able to hear their thoughts. Was that it? Could she listen to their thoughts? Was she what she thought she was? 
Tanya walked out of class and directly looked at the group of girls walking towards her. “God Jenny’s new hair is not cute. Why did she cut it that short?” “Oh my god I’m freaking about this class I don’t want to fail while all of my other friends pass. It’s going to be so embarrassing.” “Ugh, I am so hungry. Pizza sounds amazing right now. Should I just ditch class and get a slice of pepperoni?” Tanya heard each and every one of the girls’ thoughts. Wasn’t this the kind of stuff people read about in comic books? Was she going crazy? She concentrating on individuals and realized she could hear every train of thought that they had when she focused on them. She was a mind reader. And a pretty good one at that. Tanya sat down on a bench and tried to take deep breaths. She looked up and saw her friend sit next to her. Wait. This was a pretty cool gift. Maybe she could use it for her benefit? She smiled at her friend and said: “If I can guess which number you’re thinking of between 1 to 1000, you have to buy me lunch.” He scoffed and looked at her. “Game on.” She smiled and concentrated on him. “The number you’re thinking of is 157.” His face lit in surprise. “How did you know that?” Tanya coyly smiled. “I know everything basically. I’m feeling a burger for lunch. What do you think?” Tanya realized that she could basically accomplish anything. She could get any job, she could pass any class, and she could most definitely make the right friends. She could also change things on a bigger scale. She could attend meeting with the President and tell him exactly what other world leaders were thinking. She could stop wars from happening! She could save the economy! She could save lives of people."
68,"Her name is Alex. She is 20 years old attending university at SDSU and she was an average student, ran track and was very social and well known at her school. One day she severely broke her ankle during practice and, after casting her ankle, her coach told her she was out for the season for injuries. Devastated, Alex went to a therapist to talk about her disappointment and to discuss the anxiety she was feeling from her inability to participate in her sport. The therapist put her in a hypnosis state in order to get to the depths of Alex’s increasing anxiety. Unaware of what she told the therapist during her first hypnosis, Alex left the office after her session and went on with her day. Later that night, Alex was washing her dishes after dinner when she picked up a pan and completely bent the handle. Unaware of why or how she even did that, perplexed Alex eased her grip and figured the pan was just old. But as she continued her night, she started to realize the extent of her new found strength. Things that she would pick up that normally were slightly heavy, became a breeze to carry, and her ankle’s pain was progressively diminishing. Shocked, frightened, but extremely intrigued, Alex starts testing her limits with this newfound power. She could pick up her fridge, she could move her huge couch, and there were seemingly no limits on her new strength. But where did this come from? How did this power randomly appear and how was she getting more and more strong as time went on? Could she control it? Would this mean that Alex could possibly get back into her track season before it was too late? What would she tell her coach? “Hey coach, I know my ankle was shattered yesterday but I woke up with insane strength and my ankle is completely healed.” Now she just sounds like a looney. What could she do with this. Alex called up her therapist and told her what had happened. Her therapist seemed to have been awaiting her call, she knew the gift she had given Alex. She told her to use it for good, to save people and to help her team, and to use her strength to benefit society. So Alex, finished out her season, graduated college, and went on to be a fire fighter. She saved more lives than any of her co-workers, male or female, because of her incredible strength to knock down walls and carry multiple people out at once. This gift, this power she attained not only saved Alex from anxiety and depression, but helped keep her community safe."
69,"Caroline was an average girl who went about her days with average thoughts and average actions. She came home to her average family and talked about her average daily happenings and went to bed dreaming average dreams. That is, until one day she woke up feeling different. She didn’t feel average. She opened her eyes and found herself staring at the ceiling just as she usually does every morning when she awakes. But, something was different. This time, the ceiling was merely inches away from her face. Caroline was floating! Upon this discovery, she flailed her arms and legs about and screamed. What was happening?! She looked down at the ground – what seemed miles and miles away from her body – wishing for the comfort of her feet being planted on the hardwood floor of her bedroom. Both of her parents had already left for work and she had no one to help her on this seemingly average Saturday morning. Caroline willed with all of her might for herself to gently glide back down to her bed. And just as she willed for it to happen, it did. She remained calm and waited for her body to slowly sink back to the warm embrace of her comforter. She then sat upright in bed, examining her hands and feet. She ran up to the full length mirror on the other side of her bedroom and stared at her perplexed reflection. Nothing looked different. She still had the same shoulder length brown hair, same dull brown eyes, same height and weight, same normal looking clothes. But, she felt different. An unknown energy coursed through her veins. She contemplated trying to make herself levitate again. And just as soon as the thought reached her mind, she felt her body lift off of the ground. She was levitating in the center of her room. She thought about moving over to the left and as soon as the thought crossed her mind, it happened – all with the control of her own. For the first time in her life, Caroline did not feel average. She felt extraordinary. She felt powerful. She felt different. She could fly! Caroline decided to take her powers out to her backyard where she could hone them – though not much more of that even needed to be practiced as she seemed to be in complete control of her thinking and movements. She dashed to the privacy of her backyard, but then decided that she could just fly there instead. Without anyone there to witness her newfound power, Caroline flew around the backyard. She flew right and she flew left, up and down, all around. She flew so high that she knew everyone in the world could see her if they would just look up and notice her. But, of course, they did not. No one looked and no one gawked. Caroline slowly drifted back down towards her grassy backyard. With the weight of what she had just realized weighing down on her, she slowly sulked back inside her house towards her bedroom. She thought that her power was useless if no one else was around to appreciate it. But, as the moments ticked by and she processed what was happening to her, she changed her mind. She was wrong. Of course, it still mattered. Whether or not other people could see what she could do did not determine whether or not she could still do things. Being able to fly without people knowing is much better than not being able to fly and everyone knowing that she could not fly. Who cared if no one would believe her? She could do something no one else could. She could fly. And with that thought, her body began to float with all the ecstasy of her epiphany."
70,"Hovo Kyurkchyan
The day just started. His alarm screamed at the top of its lungs at 5am just like every other morning. He got up and started his daily morning routine. First he showered, then got dressed and headed to work. On his way to work he stopped at a hotdog stand. “Hey Sam!” said the owner of the hotdog stand like he did every day. As usual, he got a regular hotdog with ketchup. 
Sam lived a dull and alienated life; same routine every day…. Until today. On his way to work, Sam tripped on a bump on the sidewalk. Suddenly, while falling, everything around him stopped: the people froze, his hotdog which flew out of his hand froze, the cars froze, and everything just froze (except Sam). He caught himself mid fall and realized that everything had stopped. He did not know what to make out of it, so he just started running. As he ran, it seemed like everything was speeding up, that everything was being fast forwarded. Sam stopped in his tracks and everything turned back to normal. He looked at his watch and noticed that over 2 hours had passed as he ran for about 2 minutes. 
What should he make of this? “I can control time?” he thought to himself. He decided to call in sick to work and explore his new findings more in depth. He walked back the way he came and tried to trip on the same bump he tripped on before, but nothing happened. He then tried to run, but nothing happened. He eventually got home and sat on his couch, trying to comprehend what had taken place. So he closed his eyes and tried to concentrate. He tried to stop time as he did before, but he couldn’t! He tried for hours on end. Sam got frustrated, so he grabbed the glass he had been drinking water from and threw it across the room. As the glass flew, time stopped. Sam walked to the glass and grabbed it. He looked at his clock, and it was still. 
Sam realize his powers are triggered when he does things instinctively. He thought that he should use his powers for good, so one night he put on a hoodie and headed for dark allies. He walked until he saw a drunk man about to strike a woman behind a bar. Instinctively, he tackled the man and time stopped. He then tied up the man, took the woman’s phone, dialed 911, and placed it in her hand. He then ran away, which speed time up, when he looked back, the police had already arrived and arrested the man. This was the birth of the superhero, Father Time."
71,"It was very strange the way I could understand people’s feelings. Everyone said I was only being intuitive and sympathetic, but anytime a person around me was feeling some strong emotion, I could sense it as well, even if no one else could. I first noticed this at school, when my friend JC was upset and I asked him what was wrong and everyone around me looked really confused. “What?” I asked them. “JC is fine, he just made a joke to us about his cousin,” another friend stated. Later on, JC had told me that he found out he was moving to another state next year and that it was very strange that I had known, since he was trying to be secretive about it. 
Things like this happen to me on a daily basis and I became known as “the Therapist” because I was really good at understanding people’s feelings, but something felt different after last week. All of a sudden, I could see faint images when observing people and trying to determine their feelings and emotions. They were images that I had never seen before, maybe in a dream perhaps. This was all very strange for me and I hadn’t realized what was going on until I had seen the strongest image yet. It was when I was looking at my sister. She’s a baby and of course has no way of telling me how she feels, but when I looked at her and tried to determine her feelings, it was then that I realized I was reading her mind. I could see what she was seeing, all from her own perspective and could literally picture her feelings in my head. I was astonished to find out that it was possible to have something like this. Everywhere I go, I’m bombarded with images and feelings and scenarios in my head, none of which are my own thoughts or from my own brain. There’s no one I could tell about this, of course, but just knowing I have this power is something I would’ve never imagined. "
72,"It had been a disastrous week, and once again, he found himself running for his life. He thought to himself of how he could have avoided all this trouble if he had simply decided to mind his own business and not listen in on the conversation the group of strangers have had. Now here he was, running through the cold lonesome night being chased by these strangers who unknowingly had turned out to be mobsters. He thought back to the time where he was a kid, the very limited memories of his parents and how tragic his life had become since the day of their murder. He knew he couldn’t let what he had heard from the mobsters happen, he had to do it in honor of his parents and prevent the mass shooting they planned to do in city hall. As he ran down the dark alley he came to a dead end with the mobsters’ right behind him. With almost little time he reacted and entered the abandoned factory to his left through a broken window. As he jumped down he landed in a boiling pit of toxic waste. He screamed in agony as his skin burned in pain and his cells became flushed with radiation from the waste. Suddenly he awoke from his sleep, it was morning. He felt sore and weak he needed to find something to eat. As he settled out through the window he jumped down into the alley but as he landed he dislocated his foot. He did not feel pain. He simply jammed his ankle back in place and carried on. He began to think of the beating his foster parents would unleash on him for not having come home the night before but he had no explanation, they never believed him either way. He got home, where they awaited for him with a heated iron rod in hand awaiting his punishment. Once again he felt no pain but decided to lay a shriek in order to ward off his foster mom from continuing with more severe punishments. Later that day he realized that the toxic waste had changed his anatomy, he seemed indestructible. He decided to test what else he was capable of doing he bashed against his basement wall and broke it and underlying old secrets. He found old newspaper clippings of his parent’s death and there he found that the murderers had been the mobsters from the night before who had escaped prison based on a technicality. He decided it was time for him to do something and seek justice for what they had done to their parents and avoid deaths of others, avoiding their children to go through what he had gone. Off he went in search of the mobsters and finally he found them preparing to follow through with their plans for the massacre. Equipped with only a red mask over his face and the metal rod which he had been punished with he unleashed his fury upon them. One by one he fought off taking few gunshots to the body but they failed to stop him. He felt no pain. He wiped them out entirely and thought to himself of what a hero he had become. His idea for justice had been overtaken by revenge and he felt good about it. He took one step and fell to his knees. Memories of his parents flushed his mind and this time he did not cry. Pain was eradicated from him both mentally and physically. He was no longer a nobody."
73,"It was just like any other day for Rhonda Rotter, she was in school, daydreaming about all of the other places she would rather be. This particular day, the class was talking about tropical environments and their effects on animals and climates when Rhonda found herself in a rain forest in Chile. This was unlike any normal daydream she usually had but much more visual – she could feel the moist air from the sky and smell the dewy trees and plants around her. She tried to wake herself up; she began to pinch herself in order to appear back in her school classroom, but nothing was working. Suddenly, she saw a monkey in front of her, swinging across all the trees in the rainforest and finally setting his eyes upon her. She stood still for a while, still believing this MUST be a dream. The monkey soon jumped on her, and there was no hiding that she was no longer in the class but in an actual rainforest where she had been daydreaming about! The monkey was real as was all of the environment around her. Rhonda realized now that she had a special ability to teleport wherever she wanted to during her daydreams. In order to test this realization, Rhonda once again began daydreaming of somewhere she wished she could be and when she regained conscious control of her thoughts again, she found herself in Australia surrounded by Kangaroo’s along with the joey’s which lay in their pouches. The mother kangaroos thought she was there to attack their offspring though and took action, encircling her, threateningly. Rhonda knew what she must do, and in order to get out of there as fast as possible she immediately started daydreaming about the last place she felt safe so that she could go back to that place. When she regained consciousness once again, she was back in her chair at school and her entire class was waiting for her to answer her teacher’s question, “If you could be in any place in the world right now, Rhonda, where would you be?” Little did Rhonda’s teachers and classmates know - she could now go anywhere she wanted."
74,"Jill is a 13 year girl who lived in a small city in California. Since she was young she knew something was wrong with her. Every time she touched something it would get really hot and eventually if she held it for too long it would begin to melt. Jill was ashamed of this “power” that she had. She made no friends in school because her bright pink hair would scare everyone off. The good use she found for her power was that she was able to heat up food with just the power of her hands. Jill eventually built magic gloves that allowed her to touch things without burning them. Jill lived on with these gloves till her high school days but she would doubtfully be teased for always wearing those creepy looking gloves. She wanted to take them off so badly but knew that if she did she would become this monster that only set things on fire. She was unable to live the normal teenage life. Jill was never asked to dances nor did she make any friends until Jeremy became a new student in the school. From the gecko, he found Jill to be a very interesting girl. She was amazed by her bright pink hair that lit up once it was in the sun. One day he approached asked her name and why she didn’t seem to talk to anyone. She explained to him that she wasn’t like the normal girls that went to the school. Jeremy continued to talk to her and eventually Jill came to trust him and showed him the power that her hands withheld. He was so amazed and said “that is so amazing.” Jill explained to him that it wasn’t it because her power just made her this freak that burnt everything she referred to herself as a devil girl that brought no good to the world and Jeremey yelled “You are not evil. You think that your power of fire is bad? I don’t see this as the power as fire but I see it as light. You have the power to turn things on, to light up what is dead. Don’t you see you are light. You brighten up the world with that power that you withhold.” Jill was shocked. She never thought that her power had anything meaningful to it until Jeremy shed his own “light” upon her. She realized that she was the light that brightened up the world. With her power she was able to brighten things that had no life within them anymore. "
75,"  Jimmy wakes up at seven in the morning as he usually does on Sunday mornings. He is preparing to go on a morning run with his dog Wolfy. Jimmy’s run takes about one to two hours, this includes his stop by the local bakery on the way back home. He slips on his Adidas running shoes and heads out the door. Jimmy has been looking forward to this run all week because he’s been embodied by stress as it has been election season. Jimmy dislikes the two frontrunners for the top two competing parties, therefore he joined the race to presidency as a third-party member. He’s done very little advertising and spent very little money. All of his campaign has been ran through the use of social media; twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Jimmy knows the chances of him winning the elections are about the same chances of him winning the lottery. He walks out the door and begins a slight jog down the street. The sun is bright, the streets were clean, and the trees were green, he waved hello to Mama Joyce who lived in the yellow corner house. It was a normal Sunday, once they reached the local park, the slight jog transformed into a sprint and Wolfy had clearly been working on his cardio as there is no sight of him being tired soon. 
  Jimmy returns home with a shirt full of a sweat, an exhausted Wolfy, and a bag of sweet bread. He turns on the TV to see his face on every channel reading “President Jimmy Jim”.  Words were nonexistent at this time, jimmy lost feeling in all his body and fainted. He gained consciousness and managed to realize he was now in charge of an entire society. His confidence grew and he kept his same routine on Sundays.   "
76,"What was going on?
First there was an alien invasion, then there was that weird announcement, then there were the floating rocks in the sky, and finally there was this. This thing floating in front of her. Cordelia didn’t really have a choice in the matter, did she? It was touch the capsule and probably die, and it was walk away from the capsule and probably get murdered to be someone’s last meal. 
At least this way she knew she probably wasn’t going to be bitten death. 
--
That had been two years ago. Two years before she invaded Nightingale March and two years before she’d found herself here, after dueling Reina for their lives and emerging victorious. This was the first time in those two years she’d ever willingly killed. 
Man, those star people were messed up, if they terraformed planets and blessed—or was it cursed?—native sapient species with supernatural powers for their entertainment. But for the chance at one, limitless wish? Cordelia thought being a puppet in a show was worthwhile.
But now was not the time for that. Now was the time to be confused. Out of Reina’s limp form a glowing flower was blooming, facing towards Cordelia the way other flowers face the sun. 
It beckoned her. In some way that Cordelia couldn’t understand, she felt compelled towards it, to touch it and see what would happen. 
It wasn’t normal for flowers to bloom from dead people, even if they had Auras. She’d seen enough people die to know that. June, Apex, and Charity were all such people, had all been her friends, and never once had Cordelia seen this. 
She touched a single petal of the unearthly flower, and everything spun. The air as knocked out of her, and as she fell it felt as though she was being kicked down and someone was stepping on her chest. 
A trap? Energy had been Reina’s element, after all. 
But it was over too soon to be a trap, and Cordelia’s glove and the gem embedded in the back of her hand had both changed. The deep brick red was flecked with gold, the same gold that lined Reina’s mirror. 
The earth was not Cordelia’s in the way energy had been Reina’s; the earth had never been hers in that way. Cordelia dominated the earth, did not nudge and prod it like Reina did energy, and something told her that she, too, could now dominate energy. She could dominate anything, but she would have to kill for it.
Too bad Phantom was dead. He’d have applauded her now."
77,"There once was a girl named Madeline. She always knew something was special about her, as if she had some greater, unknown purpose. She dabbled in her own fantasy worlds, always believing that they weren’t too far from the truth. She believed that there would be something greater for her, something that was magical. Although, she dreamt of this, none of her dreams ever came to fruition. However, she would still go about her seemingly mundane life and exude magic. This magic was not supernatural magic, but her own, a magic that came from her own light that she emitted. One day, as she was walking to school, she did nothing different from her typical routine, however, something was different. She felt as if the world had changed overnight, like maybe everything she had ever hoped for became a reality. She walked to school, sat through eight hours of 9th grade material, and walked home. She was disappointed that her intuition proved to be wrong, but she was unprepared for what came next. She went to take her dog for a walk and saw new surroundings. Maybe not a new driveway, or new people, but a new view. Everything was more vivid and more beautiful. She felt like she was truly seeing for the first time in her life, not just with her eyes, but with every part of her being. And suddenly, time stopped. Everything around her was frozen and she knew. She knew her purpose and what her abilities were. She realized that she could stop time, fast-forward, and rewind. Not only did she have this new ability, but she finally understood herself in such an extraordinary, insightful way. Nothing was ever the same. After that, she went about her days as usual, but now she was able to see the beauty in time and the beauty within herself. Her powers weren’t just about having some cool, unique ability, but about being able to understand the world better so that she could help others to understand how she understood. She could never articulate what this all meant, but all she knew was that there was something special brewing, something that could change the world. She could change the world. As misunderstood as she was and as misunderstood as she was about to be, she took solace in the fact that she was special. This didn’t satisfy her in such as she was better than everyone else, but that she saw everything so beautifully and could possibly get others to see what she saw. And maybe all along, this was her purpose: not to travel through time all on her own accord, but to teach people about what she learned along the way. Truly, she was given the gift of sight, the gift to see the world through a magical lens. She was given happiness, she was given truth, and she was given empathy, beyond what anyone else ever thought they knew. She traversed the world and surprised others with her inner beauty. She gave people things that they always wanted, but could never get: someone who would love them unconditionally on their own terms. She looked at people and saw them for who they were, who they are, and who they could be. She smiled at people with enough love to last a lifetime, all because she knew, she knew what truly mattered in life. She was able to strip the world of misconception, materialism, and greed, and see what it all amounted to. She lived her life with a fervor and a drive that inspired people and gave them the unexpected. People could feel her love emanating, and she could feel everything that they felt and see what the world had in store for them. And she could just stop in time and look around along the way. She was free."
78,"     I never used much attention to what anyone else thought.  There’s this story about an egg I read a while back, and the writer had a theory that there only is one conscious person in the universe, and everyone else around that person is just a shadow of that consciousness reborn into a different life.  I liked to think that theory was true; it’s my life, so why should I bother concerning myself with what other people feel, right?  Like I said, that is how I used to think.  I sort of disproved that theory when I woke up one day and could feel almost everyone’s emotions but my own.
     It was a Monday morning, and I had been out all weekend with some friends from the rowing team, so I woke up with the lingering pangs that came with numbers of empty shot glasses.  I remember dreading waking up, knowing that the high keening that was my Political Thought professor’s voice would only serve to amplify my already growing headache.  Soon after forcing myself out of bed, though, I felt a sudden surge of energy just as my roommate, Chris, came back from the gym.  I vaguely wondered if it was some lingering intoxication from the night before and shook it off, dressing and leaving for class shortly after.  
     There was a weird sort of energy that cold, Monday morning.  I went to a small liberal arts school in upstate New York, and the trees were just beginning to shake off the harsh cold of February.  It felt as though the coming spring was not only bringing color to the trees but brought a liveliness, an energy that I hadn’t felt before.  I was walking past the stoner bench near the river when my chest came in contact with something warm and soft, and I found it was a girl, Lucy I think her name was, that I had hooked up with a few weeks before.
     “Hey, Jordan,” she said, her cheeks pink from the cold and probably a decent amount of embarrassment.  I paused momentarily, both struggling to remember her name but also unnerved by a sudden sensation of awkwardness.  Sure I felt bad that I never called her back, but it was a small school.  I had run into her before.
     “Hey… Lucy, right?” I guessed, shoving my hands in my pockets.  
     “Lauren,” she corrected, and I suddenly felt both annoyed and ashamed, like my parents had just lectured me on bringing a girl home after a party."
79,"Yesterday, my sister told me I had to go to the store. Now this might seem insignificant, but you don’t understand. I got to go to the store to decide what our whole family was going to eat for dinner. “The green beans I’m usually forced to eat won’t make it into tonight’s meal!” I thought.
“I’ll pick you up when my nail appointment ends!” I barely heard my sister because I was already halfway into the store, trying to decide how many courses we would have. Six seemed like a good number. For the first course we would start off with a simple appetizer – Totino’s Pizza Rolls. I opened the freezer (wishing I had worn a jacket) and reached all the way to the top shelf to grab a box of original flavored pizza rolls, which Mom never lets me get. Good thing tonight I was making the decisions. While I was in that isle, the mozzarella sticks caught my eye, and I figured that could be our second course. They were impossible for me to reach, but luckily a lady next to me offered to grab them for me (She seemed like she was almost laughing, I couldn’t figure out why).  
I skipped right past the produce section happily, and went to the bakery where I got some garlic bread because I hadn’t figured out what I wanted for the rest of the meal yet, and that’s when I saw it. I had tried countless times to get Mom to buy it for dinner, but she always refused. “Do you know how ridiculously bad that is for you!” I heard her screaming in my head. Too bad she wasn’t here to stop me! Today was the day I would finally get to bring it home, and it would be the perfect third course. I grabbed the largest box I could find, and I couldn’t stop myself from smiling because of the delicious dinner I had ahead of me. I kept imagining my dad biting off the heads of the dinosaur chicken nuggets, which made me laugh.
For the fourth, fifth and sixth courses, I grabbed a Claim Jumper Chocolate Satin Pie, eight Twinkies (two for each of us), and a box of donuts from the bakery. It may have seemed like overkill, but if Mom, Dad, and Sis didn’t want to eat it, it would just be more for me anyway! I was heading to the checkout line when I remembered that I needed drinks, so I got a 12 pack of Hawaiian Punch, and another of orange soda. I waited in line and made it all the way up to the register, paid the cashier with the $40 my sister gave me, and put the change in my pocket. When I got outside with my cart she was already waiting for me, and I loaded everything into the trunk.
Once we got home I pulled everything out of the trunk and went upstairs to do some homework. I heard my mom yelling at my sister about letting me choose dinner, and I heard her say “I guess I’ll just order pizza.” So much for that!"
80,"The realization of my power didn’t really give me any comfort.  Quite the opposite, in fact—it felt as though someone had just laid a heavy weight across my shoulders.  But that’s not quite right either.  No, instead it sort of felt like I’d just realized that I’d been carrying this weight for my whole life.  Now that I’d realized it, part of me wanted to get it off, to see what it would be like to go through life unfettered.  Yes, that would be really nice, wouldn’t it?  But now that I knew, some part of me knew that this was to become the reality of my life.
When I was younger, I always had this perception of wanting to be someone.  I came to that cynical conclusion early in my youth that I was no different from anyone else.  The same things that I loved and hated had been loved and hated many millions of times before I was born, and they’d be loved and hated many millions of times when I was nothing but worm food.  But at the same time, I would watch movies and TV shows, and I would read books and comics about these people that were…well, they were people.  They may not have really existed, but in some way I think they had more existence than I did.  Take Spiderman for instance—or who in the world can say that they’re like Superman?  I treasured reading their stories as a kid.  It was probably just because all kids like those stories, but maybe it was because I admired the uniqueness of their persons.  I dunno, I’m not a psychologist or anything.  Part of me probably wanted Superman to show up at my door one morning and declare that instead of going to school with all the other suckers, I was going to spend the day fighting crime with him.
Well, I guess now I’m Superman, or Spiderman, or Green Lantern, or somebody.  I was now Someone.  For someone whose entire process of growing up was the process of resigning himself to not being Someone, this came as quite a shock.  It wasn’t comforting, as I said before, but it filled me with a sort of childlike glee.  For a minute no one moved a muscle; we were all stunned by what I’d just done.  Even with all of those eyes on me I could feel my eyes tearing up for joy."
81,"Once upon a time there was a young lad named Nerp.  Since he was an even younger lad, Nerp fancied himself a ladies lad; there was always plenty of ladies around for young Nerp.  One fine evening after his badminton practice had ended, Nerp decided to do his regular hobby of chasing young ladies.  He put his athletic bags away and hopped in his silver Volkswagon Jetta with one destination in mind: the driving range.  Nerp never actually golfed at the driving range as he was afraid it would ruin his badminton form.  All he actually did at the driving range was hit on young golfing women.  This time, however, there was only old men at the driving range so he decided to pick up a basket of balls to swing at.  Young Nerp walked up to the tee and placed his ball.  “THWACK” went the first ball, and “THWUCK” went the second.  He hit a third and a fourth, and to his amazement, they all were flying beyond the range of the range! Nerp was a golfing prodigy, and he was only now just realizing his talents.  He hit a fifth and then eventually the rest of his basket with glee.  But at the end, upon fully realizing his incredible superpower in golf he also supposed that he had wasted his life not being a golf superstar.  To him, the ladies at the driving range were now only demons that had kept him away from his superior talent.  Badminton was the same and he was such a fool for thinking he was going to become the badminton superstar champion of the universe.  As he slammed through another basket he further realized the corollary ideas of his new realized superpower.  He hated himself.  He hated his wasted time.  He hated his obsession with badminton.  Nerp felt like a duped fool, a foolish young lad.  He also knew he could now win all the championships in golf, but none of this mattered to him at the time.  All Nerp could think about was how much of a fool he had been.  After his fourth basket, Nerp knew what he had to do.  He had to become the golf superstar champion of the universe.  Nerp sucked up his qualms, bought 10 more baskets, and set to work. "
82,"I woke up this morning, and found myself sitting on a stone in the middle of the ocean, unaware of what had happened before.
I stood up and looked around. I see the bright sun shining up in the sky, lightening the clouds up, picturing a warm and bright picture. I see birds flying around me and fish swimming deep in the ocean. Yet, I could not smell anything and I even felt a little difficult to breath. 
Accidentally, I found a big hole on this stone, big enough to hold a human body. I did not know why I chose to jump into the hole, but the end was I did jump.
I found myself drowning in the ocean, faster and faster, contradicting to the scientific knowledges I had learned. And finally, I lost my conscious.
When I woke up again, I found myself still on the stone, questioning the things that have just happened. I stood up and looker to the things around me. I can see “birds” with long tails flying around me, and I can taste the saltiness of the air. I looked down to the ocean and found white and lighted cloud-like things flowing deep down there, the fishes swimming seemed to have wings grown. I try to feel the air with my hand and found that air was flowing around me, I was able to feel the touch of it, smooth and gentle. Now I cannot feel any temperature, but can smell the ocean, fishy and free.
I doubted.
Of course I should doubt.
My human knowledge told me that now I am standing under the ocean, in which the sky is now under my feet. Surprisingly, I am able to breath under the water, so that was why I felt hard to breath when I was surrounded by air. 
But how come? What happened to me?
I questioned myself, and meanwhile I saw a boat coming straight to where I was standing, yet, under my feet, up the surface of the ocean. Without any stop, I jumped again through the hole, and there it goes, I am back to the correct world again. I looked for help to the people on the boat, and had a ride back to the beach.
After this experience, I worked in the ocean department in a zoo and lived with dolphins and wales. I acted to people around me that I cannot breath under the water, the only extraordinary thing I was able to do was to hold my breath longer than normal people so I can stay in the water longer without any tools and train the creatures. 
It is a good work, at least, now I am accepting myself living like a fish. 
Or maybe I am just a fish, and daydreaming of myself being a human. Who knows."
83,"Clarissa was a five year old girl who only knew a life of poverty. She lived with her mother and two year old brother Nico in an old, abandoned shack in France. Every day her mother would ask for work from store to store while Clarissa wandered the streets holding onto her brother’s hand. Their clothes were old and torn; they had not bathed in almost two weeks. Clarissa loved Nico very much, and only cared about protecting him. She wanted to be brave and strong; she wanted to be like her father who had been killed trying to protect his family from a band of thugs. On Nico’s birthday Clarissa wanted to give him his favorite fruit, tangerines; because they could not afford to buy anything besides rice and beans, fruit was a luxury. She decided she would so something her father said they should never do even if they were starving: she would steal some from a fruit stall. She wanted it to be a surprise for him, so without waking him, she left the shack early that morning to get some fruit. She arrived the stall, the farmer was only just opening, and she waited for the best time to take one. Clarissa kept repeating to herself that she would run as fast as she could and then run back to the shack without looking back. When she saw her opening she did just that, but when she opened her eyes she realized everyone, and everything around her had frozen. She could move around and interact with people and objects, but it was as if time had stopped.
That is when Clarissa realized that she had the power to stop time, and that with this ability she could get anything she wanted- her family would no longer live in poverty. "
84,"Every Tuesday morning I walk to class extra early to see the boy I’ve had a crush on since the beginning of my sophomore year. He doesn’t always see me waiting, so I just wait for my class to start. Tuesday’s are my favorite mornings for this strange reason. As I was walking through to my section one of those mornings, I realized something very unusual. I was getting this warm feeling inside my body. Different from other times that I had seen him. As I approach to class and get closer to crossing paths with him, I realized I can somehow hear what he is saying, yet, his mouth is not moving. “Is it that I can read his mind”, I thought to myself. “NO! That would be crazy!” I told myself I would forget what I thought that I heard that morning as he approached me. I didn’t pay much attention to what he was thinking because I was too shocked that I this was happening to me. I decide to wait till the following week just to see if it was one of those mornings where I just randomly start reading people’s minds, or if I was actually going through some weird phenomena where I am capable of reading my crush’s mind. Maybe this time I will keep conversation with him and see if I can catch him thinking something that he couldn’t really say to me. Tuesday the following week, I go straight to him, “Hi, how was margarita Monday last night?” wait why would I even ask him that? I already can tell whatever he’s thinking I was not going to be happy with. On the contrary, he responds, “IT was fun! Why weren’t you there?” Before I can get my thoughts out of my mouth, I caught him thinking again. “It would have had more fun if you were there with me.” WAIT! Was I really comprehending this correctly? If I’m catching on, I think he has a crush on me too? But even worse can he also read my mind as I think of this? I didn’t know whether to continue thinking or just simply respond to him. Why couldn’t I just tell him I was at the library and couldn’t go? My thoughts continued racing because I couldn’t pin point why I would be only able to read his mind but not everyone else? So is this just a thing where people who like each other could read each other’s mind? Maybe now I don’t want to be capable of having this power. Now that I know there could be mutual feelings. I can get rid of this, me and whoever else holds this great power. "
85,"With a start, he jerked his head and a loud bang followed. 
“Shit!” he yelled out as reached toward forehead, stinging with pain. At first he was confused, but as he started to wake up a bit more, he realized where he was. It was the middle of the night and his roommates lay motionless in the beds above him, fast asleep. As he started to come to, he still had an eery feeling that something was still off. 
As he peered around the room, he began to notice a slight shimmer on the edges of his vision and around the objects in his room. He reached out towards his blanket and it felt normal, but something in his head told him that it wasn’t real. Neurons in his brain were firing, signaling that he was touching something, but he couldn’t believe that this was happening. He sat motionless for a moment, and concentrated. He tried to remember the night before, or how he got to where he was, but he couldn’t. Then he remembered. 
“I’m still dreaming!”
Before falling asleep last night, he had plugged himself into his most recent invention, a device he hoped would lead to effortless and on demand lucid dreaming. 
“It must have worked!” he thought to himself with glee. When he stood up, he felt a huge amount of power surge through him, and with almost no effort he leaped up, crashing through both stories of the dorm building and into the night sky. As he rose he admired the thousands of stars twinkling above him and the beautiful campus laid out before him. He reached the peak of his jump and his stomach dropped for a moment as he began to descend, fearing the inevitable smashing of his body against the ground below him. But he never made it to the ground. As he was falling he thought hard knowing he had to act quickly before he hit the ground and woke up. Suddenly wings sprouted from each side of his back, spanning over 15 feet on each side. Slowly he tried to get used to the new muscles he developed to flap his wings, and he was soon gliding through the air, several hundreds of feet above UC Santa Barbara. The wind overwhelmed his ears and an aura of complete relaxation and content came over him.
As he soared above he contemplated his invention. The applications were practically endless and he was filled with joy over his success. "

She was across the bridge when I saw her. I thought she wouldn’t notice me, after all, mother is always talking about how I scare the literal spirit out of her because I walk like the dead. But I think she just uses it in vain, because I doubt she has anything in her. Shes a monster disguised as a loving mother., The lady disappeared into the building that was overflowing with wildflowers and vines and made a sharp right. Now, I want to clarify that I am in no way stupid and I should have realized she was luring me in, but I could not stop my feet from moving forward, neither did I want to. Soon enough I found myself inside the building and then the inanimate vines that before only moved with the wind, suddenly began to twist and tangle with each other until I no longer could see where I had come from. THAT was the moment I knew I was in deep shit. “Yesubai”, I heard my name in a monotone voice. I looked up and I was not surprised to see my mother uncloak herself and remove the shall from around her hair. “I thought I told you not to wander so far from home”. 
Then I was blinded. And the next moment I felt her cold hand on my shoulder. Even through my thick shoulder pads and cloak I could feel her bony, icy palm. I tried to speak but I couldn’t. it was as if I did not have any control over myself. With her lips nearly touching my ear she whispered “it took you long enough”. Then I felt her slap me down and her finger nail felt sharp against my cheek. She had drawn blood. I was on the floor too in shock to react. What was this? I mean I know I mentioned that she was a monster but I did not mean it, not really. She was just a pretender at home, she was short and curt with everyone but father. And then outside the home she appeared to be a loving doting mother. No one, not I nor my brothers dared to even speak about it. It was an unspoken agreement among us. Then I realized that all the whsipers around town about there being a witch uprising were true. I was horrified when I realized that I was to join the next generation of witches. I dont want to make people love me, not this way. Not my mother’s way. I couldn’t fathom having to snatch the souls out of people’s bodies in order to live. I would rather die. 
Seconds later I could see again and I saw my blood on the grass and the pavement. “its done” she said. I finally mustered the strength to yell “what is done?! What did you do!” I was mortified. She looked back at me as she was walking away and a"

My name is Emily. Until yesterday, I was your average teenage girl. My daily routine consisted of going to school, playing soccer, and hanging out with my friends. Now, I find myself with an extraordinary ability. A power which I have difficulty controlling. 
I think it all started after my accident during the final playoffs at my school’s soccer tournament. A girl and I both jumped up to head butt the ball, but we ended up clashing heads instead. Last thing I remember was a ringing in my head as lay down on the rough turf. Next thing I know, I wake up in the hospital, and I hear a bunch of low voices all around. There were so many, I couldn’t make any sense of it. As I gained consciousness, I could see my parents talking with the doctor. The doctor was explaining how I suffered a concussion. That’s when I realized my head felt a bit sore. Then, as I focused my attention back to my parents, I heard my mom’s concerned thoughts. That’s right. I said I HEARD her thoughts. I looked at her closely and realized her lips weren’t moving. I could actually read her mind! I was freaking out! I thought I still must have been in a coma dreaming. Of course, I kept this information to myself. I didn’t want to worry them that their daughter might have gone crazy. "
88,"There once was a girl who lived a normal, content life. She had a decent amount of friends, had a good family, and lived a typical teenage life. One day, she woke up and went on with her regular morning routine, but there was a feeling she couldn’t quite shake off. The feeling was strange, and it made her bodily senses tingle. It was a tempting feeling that she felt could be exercised and exerted if she put enough force into acknowledging the feeling. She decided to figure out what this strange feeling was and embraced the tingling phenomenon. All of a sudden, she was nowhere to be seen in the mirror’s reflection of herself! She gasped, and her heart began pounding, her adrenaline rushing. She immediately wanted to rid herself of the new occurrence and released the tension in her mind and body. Back to normal, she could see herself again in the mirror. She breathed a sigh of relief but she stood there frozen in shock and awe, wondering what on Earth just happened to her. With her determined mentality to figure situations out on her own, the girl decided to give it another go, embracing the sensation and once again, turning invisible in a quick second. What was this supernatural ability doing in her control? That was the question running in her head over and over. She had no idea what to do, but she knew she had to keep it to herself until she gained more knowledge of this unusual power. 
Going on about her schedule, the girl chose to dedicate her day to exploring the capabilities of her new talent instead of her regular routine of going to school. She decided to search through the library first to find anything on the supernatural world and what exactly is the ability of invisibility and how she came to obtain it. Strange enough, the girl came across a book with no tags or labels indicating that it was even an item that belonged to the library. It was an old, beat-up, leather-bound book that looked as if it had been tossed in a fire and retrieved at the last second before perishing. Someone clearly had wanted to rid the book forever and there must have been a reason to also save it at all costs. Her heart began racing again and she knew she had to go somewhere less public so she ran out and didn’t stop until she found a hidden trail off the side of the road. With every turn of the page, her mind ran faster and absorbed every word in the book. She learned that the supernatural ability was a curse and the longer one kept the power, the more evil it turns a person. "

Lying is a human aspect. Sometimes it is intentional and sometimes. Lying can be beneficial but can also carry heavy consequences. It happens very frequently to and by all humans in the world. Until the ability to absolutely tell whether someone was lying or not was developed by a young girl. She always seemed to be vulnerable to the people around her and that caused her to be bullied and lied to. Until she was able to see past people’s walls. She did not she had this ability at first but then she developed this rage inside that she would not let out but it ate her from the inside, but as she started to know more about the world, she became more aware and the advantages of her secret power. She would see politicians, teachers, and parents lie to her face and she would have to deal with it in a way that wouldn’t make them so vulnerable because if she let out her rage her secret would be known. As she grew up her power would destroy her in so many ways, by relationship cheaters and by people who never truly believed in her. She started to know that her power just made people around her vulnerable without them knowing and this helped find her own self because she always tried to show her honesty and her vulnerability but was always put down for it. But because of her power, she knew what it meant. She would not use her power for the government to become some sort of spy, or become a famous politician. She would use it to cure others to reach deep into themselves that would awaken this vulnerability that makes a human a human. This would make the world a better place with one small girl with a power that would create a domino effect. "

“I’m hungry.”
Little Emmaline waited for her mother, who was busy gathering papers into a briefcase, to heed her desire for breakfast. Unfortunately, her mother did not notice the petite figure of her daughter waddling behind her. Her mother’s cellphone rang, and she immediately began to yap away with the caller. 
Disappointed, Little Emmaline went into the kitchen and gazed around for something to eat. When she spotted the pack of Oreos sitting on the counter, she scurried over to the counter and reached up for the cookies. They were just shy of her little fingers. Grr, she thought. She wanted those cookies. She tried to reach for them again. Still no good. Frustrated, she sat down on the floor, crossed her arms and huffed. 
Suddenly, the cookies slid off the counter and fell to the floor with a light thud. 
“Cookies!” Little Emmaline gasped. She started to munch away. “I wish I had some milk…” She looked at the refrigerator and the door opened. A few things fell out as the milk carton pushed its away out and floated over to Little Emmaline, who stared in awe as the cap unscrewed itself. The milk carton remained in the air for her to grab, which she did. Soon, she was close to finishing the milk and cookies all by herself. 
A few minutes later, she was close to finishing the rest of the vanilla flavored ice cream. Then, the potato chips in the pantry. One by one the snacks were consumed. It didn’t matter that they were placed in the back of the refrigerator or on the highest shelf in the cupboard. Little Emmaline knew that she could get to them as long as she wanted them enough. 
She would never be hungry again."

When Sammy walked into class Monday morning his teacher asked him if she could speak to him in the hall for a minute. At first Sammy was sure he was going to get in trouble for something that he did, but he had no idea what it could possibly be. 
“Sammy,” his teacher said, “This week you were picked by the other teacher and me to be the hall monitor.
At first he was a little confused, but that passed pretty quickly. After that he was full of nothing but happiness. He basically believed that he was the equivalent of his third grade class. 
“I’m the coolest kid in school,” he thought. 
So for the next week he went around with the neon orange vest he was supplied with and made sure the halls of Lincoln Elementary were as safe as can be., and when he wasn’t patrolling it was all he could thing of doing. It was all he looked forward to day in and day out. Before he knew it was Friday and Mrs. Mulberry, his teacher, asked if he could give back the orange vest at the end of the day. He knew he had to give it back, but he really didn’t want to. He looked at the vest then back at his teacher and this continued for a solid minute.

Cheezus had never really felt special in any way, just always a little stranger than the other kids in the village. He never shared their love for the many rock-stick games and stone throwing contests, instead he just had a love for the pretty gals and animals. Cheezus was a sleepy boy, often dozing off in stone chipping class and wood cutting workshop. On several of these occasions he’d pass out staring at a glass of water sitting on the table in front of him, only to wake up to the water having been replaced by a sweet grapey juice. Only after entering his rebellious teen years was Cheezus able to pinpoint that sweet juice as the same wine him and his peers drank to loosen their robes and sandals. He was overcome with confusion, how had this wonderful social lubricant found its way into his glass all these years? He looked at the cup of water sitting in front of him on his desk at that moment and pondered the cause. Staring deep into the muddy water, from the local creek, he willed it to turn into that beverage he holds so dear. Out of the bottom of the cup he saw a swirl of crimson seep, convinced he was going mad he looked closer. To the teen’s astonishment the rest of the glass filled with the ripe red liquid, the mud seeming to have disappeared! He raised the cup to his lips and took a sip. Warmth enveloped his body as the sweet wine hit his throat. With a deep sigh, Cheezus emptied the glass and rushed for another glass of water. This time he tried the big basin his mum uses to shower and with nothing more than a sweaty brow he turned the whole thing to wine. Finally! Cheezus thought to himself, no more sneaking into the parent’s dirt hole to steal wine.

With that all the village people cheered and became infatuated with Cheezus and his wonderful powers that would bring happiness to the land for the next 30 or so years. With that Cheezus had restored the shame his family had undergone from the townspeople refuting his scandalous virgin birth. The townspeople no longer needed any whine to go with their cheez. "

After this experience, I worked in the ocean department in a zoo and lived with dolphins and wales. I acted to people around me that I cannot breath under the water, the only extraordinary thing I was able to do was to hold my breath longer than normal people so I can stay in the water longer without any tools and train the creatures. 
It is a good work, at least, now I am accepting myself living like a fish. 
Or maybe I am just a fish, and daydreaming of myself being a human. Who knows."
95,"Zudu is a dog who just realized how big he actually is. Zudu is a Cane Corso that was raised with his brother Alonzo, who is a Saint Bernard. Since the Saint Bernard is significantly bigger, Zudu was convinced that he was a small dog. Unfortunately, on a Saturday morning at 8am, Alonzo passed way. In order to cope with the sadness, the owners of Zudu and Alonzo decided to buy another dog. This dog was a very shiatzu that wanted to play all day. Zudu, a seasoned vet was clearly not in the mood to play. It was unit Zudu saw the size of the new dog is when he felt like the new leader of the house. Zudu, like most other animal started to take advantage of the new dog by bossing him around. Zudu would not let the small new puppy sit near him. Zudu viewed the dog as if he hated him. It was until the new puppy bit Zudu’s ear that Zudu slowed down on being a tyrant. Alonzo was not happy from above. Since Alonzo was so unhappy, he decided to come back from dog heaven and take over as the leader of the house. Clearly Zudu wasn’t ready for the position.

96,"In the post-apocalyptic city of Taurtania in 2120, everyone who lives there is under the authority of the Council. The head of the Council is a scary fellow named Drake. In the city of Taurtania, citizens do not have many rights, and are under surveillance 24/7 to see if they commit any wrong acts that would harm the city. As a part of their daily lives, citizens take this serum every morning when they wake up that makes them fully obedient to their authorities. This serum is the reason why the citizens do not rise against the authorities. In this culture, the citizens of Taurtania are living in famine and harm. Although most people don’t do anything about this oppression, there is one person who change the lives of many: Jake Jacobs Jacobson or known as “Triple-J” aka “TJ”. 
TJ is a scrawny, young kid who barely just turned 18. Despite his narrow and lanky build, TJ has the courage and determination of a UFC fighter. If he gets into fights, he will not back down from anyone. The problem, however, is that he is just too weak to take on anyone that is bigger than him. This does not matter anyway due to the serum that basically suppresses everyone’s emotion which prevents any backlash against the government. 
One day, a guerilla group sees the courage, determination, and fight that TJ has in him and kidnaps him. They inform TJ of a machine they have to transform his lanky build into that of an 8 foot tall person with the strength of Hercules. They put TJ in the machine and transform him into a messiah.
After this transformation, the guerilla group helped devise a plan with TJ so that they can overthrow Drake and the Council and put an end to this dystopian society. The plan was to infiltrate the building where the Council’s weekly meetings are held and to kill every single member of the Council, including Drake. 
When it was time to put this plan to the test, TJ heavily armed himself, prepping for battle. Eventually, the guerilla group stormed the building, led by TJ. The officers shot at TJ but that had no use. The bullets just deflected off of him, as TJ rampaged through the building, killing every single officer either with his guns or bare hands in close-quarters combat. Drake knew that the guerilla group was killing everyone, so he sent the rest of the Council down in the building to die while he thought he would be safe at the very top.
Eventually, TJ got to the top where Drake was. However, Drake had many weapons that were able to affect TJ in ways the regular officers could not. Drake temporarily poisoned TJ which weakened his strength, allowing Drake to stab TJ. However, this did not end well for Drake. The stabbing angered TJ, which caused him to channel all his range into killing Drake.
After finally killing Drake and the rest of the Council, the city of Taurtania rejoiced. They were free from oppression, all thanks to TJ."
97,"The timing could not have been perfect. After witnessing the fall of the Tower of Varrock, P.K. watched in horror and disgust, as people ran for their lives. His name was Peyton Kennedy, his father the great Frederick Kennedy, and he watched the atrocities M-Corp put the citizens of Varrock through, especially his father. 
Frederick was the most powerful and influential man in Varrock and owned Valley Tech Labs, Inc., or VTI. Last year, VTI developed a bioweapon with symptoms that would allow humans to shake shape of one another. Only problem: The energy required for this mechanism to occur would mean absorbing the person who’s shape one is taking, or murder. 
P.K. had been exposed after his getting off his flight, and was welcomed not by familiar faces and recognizable streets, but by streets marinating with the smell of blood. It was at his point that he realized what he had to do: Who was it that spread the virus, and to bring them down. With a fury that seemed unmatched, he grabbed the nearest M-Corp Squad Leader and with a slight growl, he whispered, “I will find who did this to me, and they will pay!”
Blood rushed to his head, excitement, memories. 
He was Peyton Kennedy no longer, but Staff Sergeant Tom Underwood, his wife’s name Nancy, and his daughter Joy. It seems there is a lot more to the story."
98,"The short story.
And one day out of nowhere, I lit up. Not the way may brother does right before he goes to school. My hand caught fire, but the pen I was holding didn’t melt. I quickly shook my hand and screamed. Instantly the fire went out and all of my classmates looked at the slightly melted pen. My teacher Mrs. Huffman, easily excited and nervous, dashed behind her podium in fear. Only after the longest minute of my life being stared at by all my classmates, did my teacher return from her safe position behind the podium. Mrs. Huffman is always embarrassed when she hides like this, and ordered my out of the room, not believing my story about spontaneous combustion. I was sent to the principal’s office for disturbing the class. On my walk to class, small parts of my body started catching on fire. I ran quickly and frantically, patting down more and more of my burning clothes. As I ran, more fire emerged from the bottom opening of my pants jeans, and suddenly realized that my clothes were not burning. I stopped immediately. I calmed down, and the fire went out. I slowly walked to the bathroom, fearful that I may again trigger the fire. 
In the bathroom, I looked at myself in the mirror. I imagined fire coming out of my hand, and little by little it eeked its way out of my hand, and grew larger and larger. I then imagined it going back into my hand and it did. I was ecstatic, I must have been the luckiest kid in the world. To test my new found powers I quickly searched for a piece of paper, and willed the fire over it. The paper did not burn. I was extremely confused and thought to myself “Burn!” and it immediately caught on fire and fell to pieces. I just grabbed my backpack and left the pieces there.
I went to the principal’s office, and see my brother there with a blackened eye. The receptionist asked me what I had done with time and I told her I had “disturbed the peace” in Mrs. Huffman’s class. The receptionist just laughed because she too was a previous student of Mrs. Huffman and was used to the frequent overreactions of Mrs. Huffman. She asked for my note from the teacher, the one that I burned. I told her it was missing and that I must have dropped it. At this she made a face, and told me to sit and wait. 
I went to sit far away from my brother because I was ashamed and embarrassed. Not of myself, but of him. He fought often, and had taken to the habit of smoking. I was not sure what else he was doing, but it wasn’t good. The principal came out and took his things, and started going through his backpack. He immediately bolted out of the door as a small bag of white powder fell out of his bag. He ran to the front doors and just barely got through them before the police outside came in. The principal and I came running after him. He had just across the street and hopped the pool fence. We watched as he sprinted along the pool when he sudden slipped, hit his head, and fell into the pool."
99,"Once upon a time there was a local kid named Bob. He wasn’t really popular, wasn’t athletic and wasn’t a top 30 student at his high school. He believed nothing was going his way and he started developing feelings for his neighbor, Gloria,  but she started dating the star quarterback with a 4.0. Bob thought no way he had a chance to compete with someone who has a full ride to Stanford and could potentially make it to the NFL.  Bob however was working at the hospital overnight to help provide for his sick mother and his dad was never part of the picture. One night he had to clean a room that was marked as highly contaminated, but since he has been up the past nights studying for the Big exams he seemed to walk by it. He even laid down on the bed for a bit and took a nap and no one really checked up on him since he always seemed to get the job done; so Bob felt he had nothing to worry about. A hour later he woke up with rashes and they started to burn, so he grabbed a cup that was right next to him and poured it all over himself. He instantly felt more pain but he continued on with his job. The next morning while changing for school he notice his body wasn’t slim and limpy anymore but instead athletic, an overnight transformation. He was amazed that he suddenly finally fit into medium t-shirts and went to the bus stop. Like always he seemed to be a minute or two late and Bob started running to the next bus stop by cutting through the alley like usual. This time he felt his legs more powerful and he easily reached the bus stop before the bus but he decided to run all the way to school. He didn’t realize how fast he was going. Later on that day in his physical education class he ran the mile in under 2 minutes and the teacher fainted. Bob was fast! He then joined the track team and he instantly made it into varsity squad even without prior experience and he was easily beating everybody. Articles published about him, scholarships being offered, his teachers suddenly gave him A’s even if he was producing the same quality of work as before, people trying to be his friends and even Nike planned to hire him right after he goes to college. This all didn’t matter to Bob as the one girl he truly loves didn’t seem to pay him any attention. He would take out the trash with no shirt on with hopes that his sculpture body will win her over. He would voluntarily do the garden work in her front yard. He even quit his janitor job and started working at the Starbuck’s shop across the street from the flower shop she works at and still nothing. Gloria was a loyal girlfriend and Bob suddenly gave up trying to go after her. At this time he mile times starting fading away and he was losing muscle at a rapid pace. He started working harder but it produced no results. He attended a good university but they revoked his scholarship after his times had dropped. He ultimately decided to drop out and attend the local CC and that’s when he encountered Gloria again and he found out she was single. Suddenly he started getting faster and schools and Team USA started to take notice into him again. This superpower wasn’t caused by the liquid or the contamination of the disease but of the love Bob has for Gloria. Eventually they started dating and got married happily everafter."
100,"To have power and to know the full extent of that power could be the difference between self-destruction and greatness. To know the full extent of power requires strength in completing hard tasks set before you, and a self-knowledge that identifies your own limits; because power is only as powerful as its beholder. If one who holds power does not possess the strength in carrying out the responsibility that comes with it, the power itself is weakened to the capabilities of it’s keeper. In order to fully understand any new found power in your possession one must confront and interrogate themselves internally to fully understand the capabilities of their own soul and personality. Only then can you find full extent of your own power in yourself to allow for clear judgement on anything set before you- including what to do when you find new power unexpectedly. 
This new “power” could also be the same exact inner power people find in themselves. Just in the pursuit of gaining knowledge of oneself could be all the power someone may need in life. In matters of perspective, I can only say that I am but one person, standing in front of a void that knows no end."
101,"The first time that Oliver learned of his power was in his senior summer of high school.  He was in the car with his friends on the way to the mountains.  His friend was driving a truck and they were on the road.  All of his friends were asleep save the driver because it was still early in the morning.  Oliver was sitting in the back right seat and was just about to doze off when he felt the car start to swerve off the road.  Something was happening to his friend Mason.  Mason, the driver was shaking violently in his seat and could no longer steer.  Somehow, Oliver knew to unbuckle himself, and exchange seats with Mason.  He didn’t know how, but he was able to unbuckle himself, then Mason, then switch seats with Mason all in the blink of an eye.  It was instinctual to him.  Oliver had always known that he was fast, but this was unhuman.  It happened so fast that no one even knew what happened.  They just woke up to Mason experiencing a seizure in the back seat.  Oliver then quickly pulled over safely and called 911.  The ambulance was there in no time and took Mason to a nearby hospital.  After he was safely in the ambulance, all of Oliver’s friends looked at him and asked how he was able to switch seats so quickly.  Oliver just shrugged and was at a loss for words.  He didn’t even know how he was able to move so fast.  
Oliver and his friends decided to still go to the mountains because that’s where Mason was being taken.  There was a nearby hospital up there.  Mason turned out to be fine and the doctors explained that he should be able to be released the next morning after they finished checking up on him.  That next morning, before everyone had woken up, Oliver decided to go on a run.  He wanted to test out his powers.  However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not seem to reach those breakneck speeds.  Sure he was running a sub five minute mile, but yesterday he could have ran a mile in under a second.  He returned back to the campsite to greet all of his friends.  One of his friends asked why he was sweating so hard.  Oliver just replied that he went for a run.  His friend jokingly asked if he was running at the high altitudes to become the fasted man in the world.  Oliver just laughed a little, but thought to himself how his friends would have reacted if they had only saw how fast he had moved the day before. 
That night, Oliver and his girlfriend Lori went on a hike to explore the mountain a little more.  They stopped by a couple of rocks in order to take a water break.  Out of nowhere, Oliver saw a mountain lion lunge for Lori.  It paws going straight for her face.  Lori was at least forty feet away.  There was no way Oliver could reach her in time, but he knew he had to try.  He sprinted towards her and felt time seem to slow down.  He was able to tackle her away right before the mountain lion would have gotten her.  He quickly got up and found the nearest large stick laying around.  The mountain lion lunged again, but Oliver quickly sidestepped it and smacked it across the face with the stick with lightning speed.  The mountain lion seemed to move at a snail’s pace compared to Oliver.  Then, the mountain lion, knowing it was beaten, ran off.  Lori quickly ran to Oliver and asked how he moved so fast.  Oliver was confused because he felt as if it was the mountain lion that was moving slow.  Then he realized that it was just all relative as to how fast he was moving.  Oliver learned that the reason he couldn’t run fast earlier that day was because he didn’t truly believe he could. "

He was lucky enough to land a job right away, and this job was his dream job, soon to be life changing for him. On this day, he decides to take a risk, and his curiosity gets the best of him.

Miraculously, his survives the toxic waste, only to find no culprit present. Worried he may lose his dream job for what his superiors may see as a lack of responsibility he does not mention the dunk to anyone and quietly leaves the room heading straight for the company showers to quickly rinse off and change his clothes. The day finishes with no one noticing his mishap. Upon leaving, he stares at his car while approaching. Touching the door handle, he realizes that his car is hot. It was a pretty cool day that turned warm, so he shrugged this off and gets in his car. On his way home, all he could think about was the sandwich his girlfriend, ex-girlfriend now, made for him the day before. He gets home and heads straight to the fridge. Getting his premade sandwich out of his fridge, he dazes out and stares at the sandwich for a while, thinking of his recent girlfriend that left him yesterday. Suddenly snapping out, he goes to eat the masterpiece. While chewing he notices a weird, unexpected feeling in his mouth. The sandwich is hot! He spits it out. “How can this be!?” he wonders. How could a sandwich that has been in the fridge for two days be hot? He dazes out and stares again, this time at his coffee pot full of old coffee from that morning. He snaps out again and goes for the coffee pot. Its hot too! He has radiation powers. The end. "
103,"I was walking to class as I normally do but something felt strange. It was hard to hear my own thoughts and I was not sure why. It seemed as if there was a bunch of mumbling coming from all directions making it difficult to focus on my own thoughts. I decided that I should get some coffee, maybe to wake myself up so I walked to the Arbor and stood in the long line of college students waiting their turn. The mumbling sounds had not gone away; in fact, they were becoming stronger as I got closer to more people. I could actually make out what some of the mumbling was saying. It was completely quiet around me, as everyone was so tired, hence they were in line for coffee but I specifically “heard” someone saying how tired they were and another complaining that she was going to be late for class because of how long the line was. I turned to look at the people in line and it appeared that none of them had said anything. Confused, I asked the girl behind me if she had heard someone complaining about the length of the line. She gave me a strange look, as if I were crazy and replied that she had not heard anyone say that. She continued to look puzzled, as if I had scared her and finally she taps my shoulder and says that she had specifically said “Ugh this line is so long, I am going to be late for my chemistry class” in her head. It was at this point that everything was starting to come together. I was no hearing people talk, rather I was hearing their thoughts. 
After grabbing coffee, I walked to my first class, physics, and sat in my usual seat next to the cute boy in class. I wanted to see what he was thinking. As soon as I sat next to him, his thoughts were blasted at me. It appeared that he was always thinking about something, first about how he really needed to do laundry, then about him and his girlfriend fighting (ugh I didn’t know he had a girlfriend already). It became so distracting that it was nearly impossible to concentrate in class because I was hearing everyone’s thoughts as I was trying to listen to the lecture. People think such strange things during lecture, you would be surprised. Some of the guys were thinking about how cute the professor was while others were doing the math problems in their heads. It became too much for me so I ended up leaving class early. 
All I needed was to find somewhere with no other people so I could relax and hear my own thoughts rather than everyone else’s. Some people wish for this to be their superpower, myself included, but I have not yet learned how to turn this power on and off. If I am able to teach myself this, then it will be cool to be able to hear people’s thoughts, however if I am always hearing what others are thinking it will be nearly impossible for me to get anything done, and I will quite possibly go crazy. 
I began to think that maybe something was just wrong with my head but then I remembered that the girl in line for coffee was thinking what I heard. This means that I am not in fact going crazy, rather I have just developed a new power. I tried to think of how this could have happened but I couldn’t think of any probable ways. Maybe some kind of insect bite like Spiderman, or maybe someone slipped a drug into my drink. It began to really worry me so I decided to go to the doctor’s office the next day. "
104,"As Zayna takes the bus to her tedious job in the city, she takes her time to leisurely people-watch. The commute is an hour north into the city, so she often sees a gradient of various types of people. She judges a woman with a large pink sunhat and takes note of the man in the corner by the exit, who oddly resembles Snoop Dogg. She questioned of the authenticity of the celebrity, but was confirmed of his identity when a young fan yelled, “SNOOP”, to which he responded. After signing the autograph, Snoop Dogg turns and glances at Zayna, but Zayna did not look at Snoop, instead, she hears a voice coming from the man’s beard.
“Zayna, what’s good, it’s the D-O-double G’s beard and listen here yo, you got a special thing going on in your brain right now yo, listen, you gotta utilize”
Zayna hesitates, she murmurs to herself, “what the….”
“Yeah homie, you got this talent, you can make beards GROW. And you know, my man Snoop here doesn’t take very good care of me, you see me right now? I haven’t been washed in MONTHS. This dread thing ain’t a good look for me girl, you gotta help me, you gotta help me GROW. I wanna look like repunzle, like the girls in the movies, like my girl Kim Kardasian (who I saw yesterday but don’t tell Kanye that). So what do you say, Zayna, will you help me? Use your telekinesis!”
Zayna, bored on her commute, was fascinated at the new opportunity for a new hobby. She focused her mental energy on growth to the talking beard. She gathered the powers of keratin, testosterone, and GHC (the growth hormone), and tunneled the ATP through her eyes. Her energy gathers until she bursts out, “MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL” and suddenly the bus shakes and shifts and Snoop Dogg is grasping onto the bus railing as his beard yells, “WOOOOOOOOOO” and grows 20 feet longer. 
Zayna is stunned by the transformation, and decides to spend the rest of her commute sparking hair growth to unsuspecting victims. 
Eight years later, Zayna sits in her empty apartment eating a TV dinner, watching the news about a woman named Zayna, wanted for crashing the economy after her acts of hair growth had spiked the cost of hair removal products. "
105,"Jessica woke up one morning and proceeded to the bathroom to brush her teeth. All of a sudden, she looks up at the mirror and sees nothing…She thought she may have been dreaming or just woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning. She went downstairs and said “Good morning” to her mom. Her mom yelled “good morning, come downstairs for breakfast!” Jessica was downstairs.. She didn’t say another word. She went back upstairs and pinched herself. She was awake. Something was up. She went back to the mirror, saw nothing again..She pinched herself in front of the mirror. She felt the pinch, but saw nothing. She started wondering if some supernatural force was responsible. She began to wonder if she was now invisible… She drank some water and felt the refreshing and crisp taste go down her throat. Her physical body was still there, but why wasn’t It visible to anybody.. 
She yelled “bye!” to her mom and went out from the backdoor to go to school. She had to figure out what was going on. She walked to school and people almost bumped into her along the way. It was almost like bumper cars, and Jessica had to avoid them, since, they could not see her.  However, one man did bump into. And this made her body come back. He turned around and said, “I’m so sorry honey.” People along the way now smiled at her, and she realized she was no visible again. She was happy, but wondered if she could switch off between invisible and visible..because having the power to be invisible sounded pretty great to her…
She said out loud “invisible!” and she immediately could not see her arm anymore. She hit her arm, with the same force as the man who bumped into her and brought her body back, and she saw her arm once again. She repeated this 5 more times. She realized she could be invisible when she wanted to and come back when she wanted to.
Later that day she said “invisible!”. She could not see her body any more and she was ready to use her powers to her advantage. First, she went to her all time favorite but super expensive clothing store. She took a few article of clothing, walked on out, and giggled. She thought this was amazing. She then decided that she should spy on some people of interest.
She was dating a guy Jason, and was really into him. But she wasn’t sure if he was seeing any other girls and it was too early in their relationship for her to ask if they were exclusive. This was the ultimate time to find out. She went to his house and stood in his room for about an hour. She adored him, so this wasn’t necessarily boring. He then made a phone call. The person on the other end picked up, and it was his best friend Max. They started to have a boring and simple conversation. But then the conversation picked up and Jason brought"
106,"There was once a girl, an everyday ordinary girl who did not have any thing that made her particularly unique or different from her peers. She went to a good school, had friends, loved her family, and generally did what was expected of her. From the outside this would seem normal and all fine and dandy, but on the inside this girl felt as if she was insignificant, she felt as if her existence was meaningless and she had no place in the world. She wanted to make a difference in the lives of others and be someone who was remembered by her peers and by those in the years to follow. 
To change this, she decided to study her chemistry book and use her knowledge to concoct a solution that would give her the ability to read at a superhuman rate and know everything she studied just from hearing it or reading it one single time. She hoped this would allow her to excel in her classes and be able to use her knowledge to better the world. Now this might not seem like the best or most extraordinary superpower to work so hard to get, but to her it meant she could continue on living a regular lifestyle and make an impact on the lives of others without carrying the responsibility of being a celebrity mutated superhuman. She could use her knowledge to help improve the health and wellness of those around her without having to deal with the stress that comes with studying and being a student. Rather than spending her days in the library overwhelmed by her surroundings, she could instead devote her time to helping others and providing them with the expertise they need to better their lives. 
This power proved to be beneficial once she happily graduated with all the happiness and energy she needed to go to a third world country. She provided them with the knowledge they needed to better their health and nutrition and also helped them to understand themselves psychologically. She knew every answer to every question and was able to use her knowledge to creatively provide solutions to their problems. Where ever she visited the people always were left better off. "
107,"Angel
There was once a young woman who spent living 35 years of her life entertaining people and making them happy. She would always have a joke for the people who lived in her town. She loved to see her friends and family laugh at all her jokes. This woman, Angel, became so well-known in her small town. One day Angel came home from work shocked and worried. She walked into a house of darkness and silence. No one was home. Not a single sound could be heard within the walls of her home. She wondered where her parents were. Angel walked outside and knocked on the neighbors’ houses and not a single door opened. She began to worry. Her heart racing. Her body sweating. All of a sudden, Angel passes out. When she wakes up, she is not able to move. She can see her surroundings. She can see who is crowding around her, but she cannot move a limb. A strange woman in the crowd speaks to the rest and says, “SHE HAS AWOKEN!” A clueless Angel is wondering what the hell is going on. “Why can’t I move?”, Angel said. Another strange woman responds to her, “Our dear Angel, you have been given a gift”. “A gift?”, ponders Angel. The strange woman explains to Angel of her duties. She says, “Everyone in your past life is gone. They have all disappeared. It is up to you to bring them back. You have given the power to bring them back, but there is one condition—YOU, Angel, must find your true self.” Angel ponder, “My true self? What do you mean?” The strange woman responded, “Your true self, Angel. In your past life, you were the type of person to entertain and make everyone laugh and smile. But were YOU smiling? Were you happy? In order to bring your loved ones back, you must find who you truly are by using the power given to you.” Angel thought very hard about this. She knew she was a broken machine on the inside. She may seem happy on the outside because all she knew how to do was make people happy, but what about her own self. What about her feelings on the inside? Angel has always struggled in her life. She never could pick herself up again after her first year of college. The only thing she could do was to make others happy by making them laugh even though she was dying on the inside. Angel began to think about all the possibilities. She had to. She needed to. If she wanted to save her friends and family, she had to become selfish and find herself. It was the only way to bring her loved ones back. All her life, she focused on the well-being of others and never hers until the day she realized that she herself must be taken care of as well. With the power given to her by these strange women, Angel was able to find herself and realize that self-care is important. She was able to realize that she must be selfish at times so that she can be happy too along with her loved ones. Angel became the angel of her town saving the lives of everyone who lived in it. She finally became true to herself."
108,"She never really understood her powers. She was so young and her mother always blamed it on her imagination. She always told her to keep her mouth shut and to focus on what really matters, which to her meant school. But to Emily, what really mattered was her ability to be different. Everyone thought she was kidding when she told them about her superpower. They called her crazy and told her she was being ridiculous. No one ever really said things directly to her but she always heard it. This is why her power was a blessing and a curse, because she had the ability to hear everyone even in the quietest of rooms. She heard every single thought, saw every single memory, and understood everything in ways no one else would know. Luckily, her best friend always believed her and Emily listened to her every day in hopes that this belief would never change. 
On this day, Emily was minding her business as usual when the school bully approached her and said to her, “Bet you can’t guess what I’m thinking.” Emily knew this would only end badly but she knew that if she didn’t stand up for herself then she would only continue to be bullied.

Sandy was especially nervous since she would be transferring high-schools after her Mothers job as a financial manager was re-located. Although the Miller’s seemed like a typical well-off American family, they kept one family secret from the world, that only relatives knew of, the Millers could read minds. 
Mind reading was no hard task for the Miller’s. If they put a fraction of their attention on a person and tried to hear their interpersonal thoughts they would be able to interpret everything going on through the persons mind. The only limit was that the Miller’s were unable to read each other’s mind because of the family tie.
Sandy was used to the routine of moving schools. She would avoid the mean girls, and try to make a few friends, none of which she felt especially close with or kept in touch while changing schools. Her plan was interrupted because on the first day she was partnered up for a Math assignment in Calculus with Maya Downfraud. Maya was known as the schools queen, literally and figuratively since she had won Queen at junior prom the previous year. She was captain of the soccer team, maintained a 4.0 GPA unweighted and was the President of many clubs including National Honor Society. Although Maya was quite accomplished, she also tried to dominate anybody that posed as a threat to her standing in any association, and especially to anybody who tried to compete with her GPA.
Sandy had been the valedictorian of her past schools for Junior and Senior year, and had been warned about Maya’s competitive side. Maya introduced herself to Sandy and made sure to explain all of her achievements, then warned her to not score as well on tests and told Sandy to choose a class to get a B in to lower her GPA.
Sandy was flabbergasted. She could not stick to her original plan. She had to get through to Maya and change her evil ways. The following day Sandy and Maya met after school at the local coffee shop to work on their math assignment. Upon arriving she read Maya’s mind. Maya was scared, she would be the first in her family to go to college and was trying to rack up every scholarship she could get, which is why her achievements had a high priority in her life. Her parents were illegal and paid less than minimum wage. Maya saw college as her escape and opportunity to go further in life then her pregnant eighteen year old sister and drug addict brother. 
Sandy understood Marta’s dilemma, but knew that changing Sandy’s GPA would not affect Maya’s college opportunities. An hour into working on the assignment Sandy asked why Maya cared so much about her GPA,  but Maya just said “you wouldn’t understand.” 
Sandy finally said I’ve been looking through some scholarship opportunities that I wouldn’t be able to get since I’m not very involved in school, but they would be perfect with you because eof all your accomplishments."
110,"Lucy was a woman who felt unnoticed in her life. In her job, she was the accountant who rarely got recognized for her job. She completed spreadsheets which were necessary for her job, but her company paid more attention to the sales team. She spent every day, Monday through Friday, not being noticed by her coworkers. Sure, sometimes someone would make small talk. Or ask if she completed the previous day’s spreadsheet, but other than that, nobody cared to know about her personal life. Lucy didn’t mind though, she was a private person and was uncomfortable sharing her life with others. Though there was times when she felt left out. 
She was at her cubicle on a Tuesday morning. She was in the middle of completing a financial statement but felt like she needed a boost. The night before she stayed up too late watching the Breaking Bad series, even though it was her second time watching it, she couldn’t stop at just one episode. She gets out of her chair and walks towards the cafeteria. She can hear a few people in there, Tiffany and Rebecca are in there gossiping like always. It was always funny overhearing their conversation because she would find out about the latest gossip. Lucy goes towards the coffee pot and fills up her Styrofoam cup halfways and tops it with the disgusting yet addicting coffee syrup. She has a seat in the lounge chair that’s in the cafeteria and looks at the two woman talking. She looks down at her cup as she takes a sip of her coffee, and when she looks up, the two women were actually two young girls. She was extremely confused, did they walk in? maybe she didn’t notice them enter the cafeteria. But she kept overhearing the conversation, and they were still talking about the same thing the women were. Maybe they were pulling a prank on her, she thought. Then again, why would they do that to her? She wasn’t good friends with anyone so it would be odd for them to take time to fool her. Or maybe the two young girls were just reciting the conversation that Tiffany and Rebecca were having. Lucy finished her coffee and hurried out of the cafeteria. She heads down the hallway towards the cubicle area, but she can’t see the people that were there before. As she got closer to her area, she people in the cubicles, but their heads are smaller and they are shorter. They were all kids. They looked about 10 to 12 years old. This time she really thought she was being fooled, or at least didn’t get the memo about “bring your kids to work” day. But they were all completing their jobs and working like the people always did in the office. She found it bizarre and asked one of the young boys what he was doing in the office. The boy replied, “oh hey lucy…I’m working on the sales report. Its been a whole week and I cant seem to get it done.” Lucy asked, “But who gave you permission to be here? Does your mom or dad work here?” he just laughed. “What? Good one lucy! Haha..well good luck on that financial statement”. "
111,"The world around her seemed calm, but she could see everything through her sense. She didn’t know what had happened, but all of the sudden she could hear the most miniscule sounds from miles away, smell the most obscure things to the most pleasant, see specific events that were currently playing through her head, and conjure any taste she could think of right then and there. To her left, 150 miles out she saw her best friend on the date she has been flamboyantly talking to her about for the past few days. To her right she could smell the amazing pancakes she adores freshly made for a customer that just walked in approximately 15 minutes ago. She could hear the ice cream man handing the children their specific selections of ice cream, visualize break ups that were happening 50 miles out, and was even able to listen intently on any conversations to her liking. What seemed like forever to her, was only 30 minutes when she checked her watch and came back to reality. She thought she was just daydreaming, but as she opened her eyes, she found herself standing in what seemed like a small meteor crater – that she created. She was at the center, and surprised that she did not fall into the water because the crater broke to the ledge of the park, leading to the nearby river. Thankfully no one was around, but she began to question just what happened. In that allotted time she seemed to be “gone” from the real world, she had blown all the leaves off from the trees nearby, any animals nearby were perfectly aligned behind her, the crater appeared, and she felt warm inside. This feeling of warmth was like that of a sensation of cheerfulness of winning a prize, or being kissed for the first time. She did not know she was the one that caused all this, and could not believe it, so she decided to experiment. As she raised her hand midway to her body, the animals dispersed and went back to their daily activities, the ground beneath her started to reform back to its original state before the crater, the leaves grew back on the trees, and it seemed as though there was a slight appearance of people coming through this side of the park now.
Before anything else had happened she decided to rush back home and find out what else she could do. Camilla grew up as a foster child, but now lives alone in a raggedy, old apartment alone on the 3rd floor in New York, New York. As a 20 year old, you would not expect things to get any crazier in life seeing how ordinary it was already, but to her, things just got started. As she sat in her bedroom, with a dimly lit candle across from her on her desk, she began to think of what else she can possibly do, and what her supposed “powers” even are. She must have wanted it to be dimmer, as soon as she raised her hand, the candle light grew dimmer. Amazed, she had the intention for the candle flame to grow bigger, she flicked her hand, and the flame grew precisely the height she wanted. Camilla sat there focused, she tried the typical meditation position to see if it could help in any way with anything, but nothing. As she relaxed, laid down in bed, closed her eyes, she started to hear everything that was happening around her, smelling everything, and if she focused, she realized, she can hear and smell anything to her specific liking. 
This is when Camilla knew she could change things. Three nights past and she was confronted by a thug. Instead of running scared, she wanted to defend herself so she found that every move the thug tried to pin on her, she was able to tell what he did before it even happened and was able to counterattack…"
112,"It was an ordinary Monday morning for Karla, a sophomore in high school who hated school but knew she had to go anyway. The clock ticked past 7:30am and she knew if she did not get up within the next 5 minutes there was no way she would make it on time for her 1st class. She could not help but think of how hard it was going to be to get past a hectic Monday that awaited her but it made her happy knowing that she would see her friends at school. As she got off her bed and headed to her windows to open the curtains she realized the weather was not that of her favorite. It looked like it was going to rain. With her planned outfit laying on top of her dressing table she realized that wearing a dress was a bad idea and had to perhaps look for her rain boots. She went inside her closet to try and find her rain boots given that she placed all the way at the top thinking that spring was here and the rainy weather was finally gone. Once she was inside her closet she realized that her boots were way too high to be reached even she tip toed and stretched her arms. Her father who was always of help to her when she wanted to reach for something was at work and her mother was shorter than her. Her only option was going to the garage and looking for the ladder she always used when she needed to reach for something but she did not have the time to do so. With anger reflected on her face, Karla looked at the box of rain boots and wished that they would fall down or even be moved just with her thoughts, when suddenly it happened. The box of rain boots fell from the closet onto the floor, the box opened and the rain boots fell out of the box and scattered out. Although happy, Karla was at shock that the box had fallen from where they were when it was nearly impossible for even an earthquake to shake the box off of the shelf. While she could not believe what happened, she went on to get ready for school and head out to class. 
Once at school, she let her friend Diana know that something strange had just happened inside her closet. Her friend Diana immediately thought that there some sort of supernatural activity going on in her house (Diana was a supernatural enthusiast). However, Karla did not think that of the strange activity that had happened that morning. She was in denial to think that it could have been something more than a supernatural act. She decided to leave it out of her day and focus on what really mattered, school. In Biology class, Karla had an experiment to conduct and as much as she hated Biology she knew she had to one way or another do good on this experiment in order to pass the class. Her lab partner was Henry, one of her best friends. As he gathered the materials for the lab, Karla was putting on her gloved because she was going to be the one conducting the experiment. During the experiment, Karla saw that her beaker’s chemicals were not turning out the same color as her neighbors. She became angry at the thought that she knew she was doing something wrong. She stared and stared at Henry’s beaker with anger and jealousy, when suddenly it broke and spilled off. No one was exactly sure why it broke and why it spilled off when all the chemicals being used were not reactive to one another. Karla was in despair, she knew something was wrong and it was indeed supernatural. It was her. Everything she stared at with a desired action had that desired outcome. 
When she could not believe what had happened so she began trying to move things with her eyes, and mind. She wanted to move her mirror that was hanged on the wall a little higher so she did, without touching it. She did her bed without moving a finger. She picked up her clothes from the floor and so on. As she thought she was only dreaming it was actually her reality. She knew she could not tell anyone because then that would cause controversy and she was not exactly sure that it was not something that would eventually go away. From then on, Karla did as she pleased with her supernatural power and without letting anyone know of her supernatural abilities. "
113,"He wasn’t sure of its origins but he knew he wanted to keep it. Never before had he wanted so much to smother people with thoughts of his own, thoughts that invaded him and now infiltrated them. Everyone could always tell he was lost in perversion, fantasizing of the day the collective unconsciousness usurped humanity’s awareness and he was equal. And now that day was steadfast approaching. No longer would his thoughts be abnormal. No longer would others look on him with disdain. No longer than the time it took to speak a single word could he now fully analyze a person’s psychology, the amalgamation of every historical and ontological event that resulted in that word, and why that word, and why not the infinite others.
His first subject would have to be someone dear to him. Better to wade first in the fluids of one’s brain before becoming entangled in its folds. He was an only child, so siblings were out of the question. His father left him when he was just on the brink of forming memories. So he was left with his mother. His mother was a simple woman, born into poverty and attending a rural university for women. She had always gaped at the world open-mouthed, as though expecting it to crawl into her, for she had not the mental capacity to consume it herself.
Oh, mother, if only you knew the blessings I would bring upon you in these coming seconds you would drop to your knees and wash my feet. I am the sacrificial son, and although none may ever fathom the depth of my magnanimity my palette is cleared in helping them. I will guide the blind into clarity, I will rip out their eyes and implant mine in their sockets so that they may see the virtue in my replication. They will beg for me to mold every piece of them into a putrid imitation of my own until they stand before me as a grotesque reflection, but all the better for it.
Effortlessly he sieged his mother’s mind so that he was inside of her and he was looking out at him. And he crafted a double-consciousness with her so that his own may thwart hers. But he didn’t expect the coup. He didn’t know of her mind’s ramparts that looked already so much like his own fortifications. Then in a second he understood that she knew what he knew by different names or no names at all. He blamed it initially on their shared genetic lineage. Then he tested the minds of strangers, of vagrants and politicians, quantum mechanists and fast food cashiers, with the same result. He could never be sure if he had succeeded in replacing their souls, or if his had degraded, or if he knew more or less than when he was naïve of his power. "
114,"As you walked down the busy street, late for your work meeting, you thought about why you were even going into work that day. What else could you be doing rather than working as a slave under a huge company that could let you go at any time. What if you just quit?
Of course, you let your thoughts get to you as you slammed into a pole, others snickering around you. Embarrassed, you rub your head, pick up the bag you dropped and notice something that wasn’t on it before. Clipped to the handle of your beat up black bag is a tiny bottle with a note inside. Curious as to how it got there, you unclipped the tiny bottle and opened up the note. It read: You’re welcome. Scrunching up your eyebrows you shake your head and throw the bottle and note into a nearby trashcan as you hurry into your office building.
As your work meeting begins you hurry into the room with cup after cup of coffee. You pass out the corresponding cup to each millionaire as they talk about their tiresome evenings out at five star restaurants and with famous celebrities. Just as you’re finishing up, you trip over a briefcase on the floor and spill hot coffee all over the president of the company. Now what are you going to do? You quickly stand up and apologize profusely as his enormous mouth in the middle of his angry, red face slowly opens with rage. You wished none of this had ever happened, imagining that everything had gone perfectly fine so you wouldn’t have to deal with being yelled at by this short, bald man. Your eyes are closed as you cower back, waiting for the blast of sound from the president, but it never comes. You’re standing by the conference room door with an empty carton and the president was at the head of the table sipping his coffee with a smile on his face.
Had you just imagined it all? Was this some kind of sick trick your mind was playing on you? Unsure, but quite happy, you headed out the door and back to your desk. What had happened? 
After work ended, you left the office heading downtown to meet your friends for drinks. After what happened earlier, nothing else was out of the ordinary, so you set the entire incident aside from your mind thinking nothing of it. Your brain must have been tired from lack of sleep and stress. As you enter the restaurant you see your friends surrounded by men as always. You had always been the invisible one, sitting to the side as your friends had drinks bought for them. You imagined what it would be like to be the center of attention for once and in the next second, you’re surrounded by the same guys that had been surrounding your friends. Surprised, you gladly took all of the drinks they gave and smirked at your friends envious faces. What was happening?
Days and weeks pass and you realize what great power you have received. All of your dreams come true, no matter what they are. The only thing is, they need to be dreams. You could easily think about something you want to happen, but nothing ever happens. Only your daydreams come true, because they are things that your heart wants, not your mind. But, what could be bad about this?"
115,"Sally was a girl who did not have many friends and often found herself daydreaming meanwhile she was sitting alone throughout the day. Her single father paid no attention that Sally was always alone because he was always preoccupied with work. One day, something happened that forever changed her sleeping schedule. Sally was walking to school when something truly amazing happened to her. She was looking at a squirrel that was on a tree, running around with nuts with a whole bunch of squirrels. She thought to herself, “That squirrel is so lucky to have friends.” All of a sudden, she started getting a funny feeling in her stomach and seconds later, she found herself on the floor with tiny little furry hands and a long furry brown trail. She immediately started panicking and thinking how much better it would be to a girl. She then switched back into being a girl again. She stood there astonished at what had occurred to her. She was standing in the middle of the sidewalk, staring at her hands in shock. From the distance, she heard the school bells ringing and she knew she had approximately ten minutes to get to class. Then Sally got the funny feeling in her stomach again and had very long legs with spots on what appeared to be cheetah fur. She then started dashing towards school and was there instantly. She was amazed that no one had seen her running through the city. She was walking to her locker and trying to interpret what had just happened to her and was thinking how could this happen to her. She had turned into two very different animals in the matter of twenty minutes. She walked to her first class, staring to the floor thinking about all the research she would do in the library during lunch. Sally’s classes went on and she paid little attention to what her teachers were saying. When the lunch bell rang, she walked very quickly to the library and sat in a computer lab out of sight of the librarian. Sally sat at the computer and began to type, “HELP” when out of thin appeared a woman with white hair out of thin air. The lady was wearing a silver super hero costume and looked very familiar to Sally, she looked like someone she had seen in old photographs her father kept.  The woman said to her, “I’ve been watching you for years and this mor "
116,"She had never been much of a people-person. She was introverted, unlike her brother who was captain of the football team and student body president. She liked to stay in on Friday nights while everyone else her age went out and partied. She liked reading a book instead of watching TV. She preferred to be with her cat and dog than with people. Elizabeth was weird, as some would say. Not many people knew much about her because she was quiet and never expressed her feelings easily. She would hardly talk in class, nor to other people in the hallway, the lunchroom, or even the grocery store. Her mom would always tell her to “quit being so shy”, but Elizabeth never saw a problem with being so quiet. She loved the relationship she had with her pets and felt as though they had some strong connection that no one else could understand despite their utter differences. She’d come home from school to greet her pets before she greeted her mother. She could spend all day with them if she wanted to, as if she didn’t already. They slept in her bed and obviously favored her out of the entire family, and the only time she’d be away from them is when she was at school—she even took them with her when she would go shopping. Spending so much time with her cat and dog, she felt on the same level as her pets, as if they were “friends” and equals despite being different species. 
One day, Elizabeth was home alone watching TV with her pets, as usual. She was watching the Ellen show, something that would normally air at 3:30 every weekday, which is when she’d get home from school each day. On that particular episode, Ellen had brought Jennifer Aniston onto the show due to her newly released movie. Elizabeth liked Jennifer Aniston and so, was very into the episode. She was so distracted by the show, carefully listening to everything Ellen said and asked Jennifer "
117,"His name is Jafar, Very Jafar. He has the ability to speak to cats, but no one else knows about it. Jafar likes to spend his time with the neighborhood cats solving mysteries out of his mom’s minivan. Others think he’s crazy, but he loves the danger and mystery of using cats to help him solve his cases. Whether it’s the local jewelry store or your grandmother being robbed, Jafar will be there to solve the crime that happened and help to catch the criminal. 
He walked briskly through the cold town of Pleasantville, gazing at the dark sky filled with unpleasant weather. As he rolled on, he noticed fewer and fewer people walking downtown and restaurants swiftly closing shop. Sweat began to fall down his neck. He knew something wasn’t right. Jafar knew most of the shops would close around 10 PM, yet his clock rang 8:46 PM. Suddenly, a shadow swiftly darted from the corner of his eye. He took a quick turn into the nearby alley. With a sigh of relief, he saw a fellow feline prancing around a garbage can looking for food.
“What are you doing here you pretty little thing”, asked Jafar, “It’s a bit cold out, you should be with your family”. The young kitten responds, “I would, but the shadow is nearby and I felt a tingle in my skin when it walked by”. Jafar exclaims, “You saw it too? So I’m not crazy after all”. The feline replies, “Well, you are talking to an animal”. Jafar digs an oatmeal cookie out of his pocket and leaves it on the ground for the kitten, who scurries away soon afterwards. 
He continues his walk, slowly pacing his steps to focus his attention on any unusual sounds. All of a sudden, a faint scream runs through the block and Jafar sees some garbage cans tossed into the black pavement. He moves quickly, knowing someone needs his help. Within seconds, he finds a woman in a bright red dress dead in a nearby alley. In the distance, he sees him. A black silhouette of a tall figure with a hat and a trench coat piercing through the night. Jafar knows he can’t waste time on the dead body and rushes in the direction of the figure. The silhouette darts through the alleys, jumping fences and begins to  "
118,"When imagination kicks in due to boredom in one’s life, some people might think about castles, creatures, and fantasy, while others might think about having supernatural abilities, such as superpowers. When I think of which type of super power that I would like to possess if f possible, I would have to go with the ability to read minds and have a heightened sense of sensing the ways in which other humans might think and/or act. I chose this simply because I think that this ability would be useful, fun, and interesting. In a scenario where I have this ability, I would be born with it and begin to utilize the powers as I started elementary school.  As I move through school up until the end of high school, my powers still remain a secret for the most part until the girl that I ask to senior prom takes an interest in me eventually. I had been longing for her since freshman year, and I knew that she was not into me because when I read her mind from time to time, she would be dreaming about the quarterback. Eventually, I ask her out and she accepts. When I arrive at her house on prom with my limo, tux, and excitement, I read her mind and she seems a bit reluctant. As we leave, I begin to reassure her that this night would be one to remember. 10 years flash by and my current setting is in Japan, where I have bought a home for myself after college, and a few years of self-reflection and traveling the world. I have grown quite content with my supernatural abilities, along with my current position in life. As I wander the streets of Tokyo, the bustling streets fill my head with voices and rapid thoughts in Japanese, English, Korean, and Mandarin. Even if I don’t speak a language, I can usually tell certain people’s emotions by the nonverbal tones and association with that and how they are physically acting. At this point in my life, I have reached a very high level of controlling and utilizing my powers for good, and for my advantage. Sometimes it is still difficult for me to live and cope with the fact that I can do and think things unlike any other human. This also makes me wonder whether or not I am the only one who possess these types of powers, and if anyone else has these capabilities, or any super human capabilities for that matter. As I continue to live my pleasant yet unusual life in Japan, I am constantly contemplating what I can and should do next in life based on my super abilities. The struggle to see myself as a true individual begins as a notion that I feel, mainly due to the sense of responsibility that I feel based on my super abilities. As I look back at my past, I utilize the self-reflection moments in order to help me deal with this inner struggle, along with thoughts of shaping and deciding what my future life plans hold. This deep reflections and questioning of what the universe may hold next for me in life will ultimately help me to figure out how I can best utilize my powers for greater good, as well as the deeper meanings and the reasoning behind why I behold such powers in the first place.

119,"Ding, ding, ding, ding! It was just after 4 pm. James began to clean his desk to make room for tomorrow’s stack of papers. He began by sorting out the completed assignments by portfolio names. The ones that needed to be looked over were placed in the getting things done pile. James was quite tired. 15 minutes ago he was on the floor answering phone calls and trading equities. 
“The market was pretty bad today,” James whispered under his breath. “I don’t know if I can do this anymore. I just lost over 1.5 million dollars of my client’s money.” In his head, he didn’t know what to do, he needed to get out of the situation. He grabbed his coat and began moving towards the elevator.

120,"Stella was used to having strange dreams. Unlike some people, she dreamed every night; sometimes, she dreamt about real things, like her quickly approaching midterm season, and sometimes she dreamed about fantastical worlds where she could leap continents in the blink of an eye.
Sometimes, when she woke up, the dreams lingered in the back of her mind, tinting her perception of the world until midday, when the power of reality finally ate away at the flimsy fantasy.
When Stella woke up on Tuesday, October 8, however, the power of her previous night’s dream didn’t seem to fade. It had been an odd dream, so tangible, and the oddest part was that she hadn’t been herself. She had been in someone else’s body, someone that she knew. It was a boy in her seminar on democratic voting practices, Tom, whom she had pined over for the majority of the semester. And the dream hadn’t had that foggy quality that most dreams have, when you’re somewhere one second and somewhere else the next and you don’t question it at all. And nothing strange or fantastical had happened. In fact, it was almost like she was watching him live his life from behind his own eyes.
“What an odd dream,” Stella thought. Usually, when she dreamt, the majority of the actual content faded minutes after her alarm’s harsh ring, leaving her with only the feeling of the unconscious journey she had just taken. But this time, as she sat at the edge of her tiny twin bed, listening to her roommate breathing deeply across the room, she realized she could retrace the steps of the lengthy dream clearly and with ease.
She had come to in Tom’s mind when the clock on his computer read approximately 12:35 AM. She could sense the buzzing of his thoughts but couldn’t decode the specific content. She didn’t seem to have any control over his body, but she could detect the gentle breeze from his open window and hear the leaves rustling outside. She smelled that distinct boy’s room odor of his day’s sweaty gym clothes and the empty bowl Hamburger Helper spaghetti he must have had for dinner. He didn’t seem to be aware that she had entered his world.
As time passed, Stella bore witness to Tom’s every activity. She giggled internally as he sang Katy Perry songs to himself in the shower, and she zoned out as he played Call of Duty in his warm, dark room in the wee hours of the morning. At 3 AM, after hours of puttering around and doing everything but sleeping, Tom got up and left his house, entering the cool night. He popped in his earbuds and began listening to the Avett Brothers. Stella began to sense a loneliness as Tom dropped his head and began a somber stroll to the beach, where he sat and looked at the moon’s distorted reflection on the waves until the sun began to warm the edges of the horizon. Just as it peaked, Tom drew out his phone and opened a text to a group message named “Fam,” typing, “I miss you guys.” As he took the steep steps back up to the road, he caught his toe and scraped his shin against the stairs, drawing a slow trickle of blood. “Shit.” He continued home, patched the wound, and fell asleep. Stella’s world went back to black.
“It couldn’t be real,” Stella thought. “Can I enter the minds of whomever I desire in my sleep?” She wrote it off as another whimsical fantasy, a haunting desire to get to know this fascinating boy. She decided to go about her day, figuring she would forget about the whole thing, until she got to her political science class and saw the fresh scrape on Tom’s shin."
121,"“Breaking News! The wild animals from Zoolandia have broken free from their caves! I repeat, the wild animals have broken free!!” announced the news reporter over the radio. Mom drops the waffles that she had just taken out of the toaster. “We live a block away from Zoolandia! They are coming our way!” yells mom frantically. She rushes up the stairs and breaks into my room. “James, wake up! The lions and tigers and alligators are headed our way!” I lay in bed and my eyes widen as I heard those words come out of my mom’s mouth. I jump out of bed and throw on some kakis. I open my closet and the first shirt I see hanging has the words, “DON’T BE A HERO” on it. It was my community service shirt I had received back in the fall. As I put the shirt on, I notice unusual marks on my wrists.
What could these marks possibly be? How did they get there?! I hear a loud cry come from downstairs. “Lord, have mercy!” I run down stairs and see my mom looking out the kitchen window. I get closer and see a mob of lions heading to our street. “Quick mom, shut every window and door!!” I run outside into the middle of the street to pull the two kids that were frightened out of their mind. I put them inside of my house and close the door. When I turn around, I see the lions about to cross the street into my block. I run to them and put my hands in the hair. As I waved them, cement came shooting out of my wrists. As shocked as I was, I swayed my arms in a parallel motion and started building a wall. I kept shooting until the wall was over the heads of the lions. Before I knew it, all my neighbors were in the middle of the street with their mouths wide open."

“Jake?” a familiar voice says to me. I recognize my name, but cannot place the person talking to me. 
Slowly, I open my eyes and immediately feel overwhelmed. The sun provides too much light in the room everything around me is floating. I see various alien looking lifeforms of various shades of blue, green and purple
“Jake?”  
“Uhhhhh”, I respond in shock.
“My name is Odin. You are on Jupiter. Do you know how you got here?” one of the aliens replies.
“No. I fell asleep and I just woke up to your voice.” 
“You just appeared in our palace out of nowhere. You must go see the enchantress. She’ll know why you’re here.” 
“Why are you guy green? I’m not going anywhere until I know this isn’t a prank.” I say angrily.
I feel two aliens grab my arms and force me to walk to into a castle down the road. Fear overwhelms me as I struggle against them. 
The enchantress stands before me in an elegant gown and explains to me that I have the acquired the ability to travel through space and time. Something in my body changes chemically as I travel, allowing me to live in the most extreme situations. She also explains that I am now miniscule, smaller than a gas particle on Jupiter. The people on Earth believe that because the planet is made of gas, there are no living beings. 
“They just weren’t able to see us” the enchantress concludes.
“Well how am I supposed to get back to Earth?”
“You’ll have to figure that one out on your own.” 
“Am I allowed to go anywhere else?”
“You can go anywhere you want. However, the mechanics of why this is happening or how you transport is unknown.” "
123,"I’m actually reading my professor’s mind right now.
I stare around at my fellow classmates in lecture: can they hear what I’m hearing too? As I look around, everyone is consumed with their exam, clearly not absorbed with the negative thoughts from our professor that are practically screaming in my head right now. Maybe it’s just me; maybe I ate something bad last night, and this is the first sign of delusion and paranoia. I mean, this exam is worth 40% of my grade, it only makes sense that I’m having some sort of feeling of paranoia. Yep, that’s definitely it! I am extremely paranoid, and it’s making me feel as if I’m hearing my professor telling us to fail, even though she has a giant smile plastered on her face and hasn’t spoken in at least 20 minutes.
Can this girl stop looking around? She’s giving me anxiety.
I whip my head towards the girl sitting next to me.
“Did you say something?” I whisper to her.
“No.” She gives me a dirty look and turns back to her exam.
Great, now she’s going to try to have a conversation with me. Idiot
Okay, she definitely did not say that out loud, and I’m officially going crazy. How is this even remotely possible? I didn’t fall into a vat of radioactivity, and I so don’t have superhuman parents who passed down their traits. I’m an eighteen year old girl from a small town in California. I’m not even from Los Angeles; cool, movie stuff like this can’t just happen to me.
I shake my thoughts away and try to focus on my exam. Slowly, thoughts start creeping into my head that most certainly aren’t mine.
I can’t believe he didn’t text me back last night.
Oh my god. Oh my god. I am so going to fail.
I am totally switching majors after this test.
I cover my ears to block out the noise, but the sound is coming from inside my head, not externally. I quickly stand up, sling my bag over my shoulder, and run out of the lecture hall, hearing confused thoughts as I shut the door behind me. Chemistry be damned. I run into the startling daylight and collapse onto a bench with my head between my legs as I try to slow my breathing. 
This can’t be happening to me. I rack my brain as I try to remember anything from high school health class about mental disorders. Is Schizophrenia the one where people hear voices? Or is that multiple personality disorder? Oh god, maybe my alter ego is trying to come out and is poisoning me with her thoughts. I begin hyperventilating as I imagine myself sitting in a padded room, talking to people that aren’t there. But wait, those people in my lecture hall were there. I couldn’t possibly just imagine the professor and the girl’s thoughts."
124,"Jesse grew up with his entire family always telling him he was the best at everything. At the age of 10 this must have gotten to his head because the poor boy started acting pretty mean to his peers. This was not an effect of who he was, it was an effect of the way he was raised. At the age of 16 he started to realize that being mean wasn’t the right way to go so he started being very nice, and by his senior year of high school Jesse was the guy everyone wanted to be. He had a lot of friends, looked good, and was very smart. 
Jesse had a lot going for him when he went into college. He was very social and was known at every club and organization on campus. He was the guy who got A’s on every test and was as every party. Just as everything seemed to be going great, one night Jesse woke up from a noise. He was living with 3 people at the time, but they were all out of town. He looked at the clock… 6:11 in the morning, but it was pitch black outside. The noise persisted and he got up. As Jesse stepped out of his room he felt a slight breeze, but it was not the type of breeze that came from an open window, it was a warm heavy breeze that carried with it a hint of mystery. As Jesse stepped into the kitchen the breeze got stronger. As he shifted his head looking around Jesse saw Superman himself. 
Turns out, Superman didn’t want his power anymore and wanted to give it to Jesse. Why? Superman would tell him later. Jesse was confused. But after accepting the power, Jesse decided that it was time to go for a little joy ride. He flew to a nearby mountain top and watched the sunrise. Thrilled with his new power, Jesse was all over the world! 
As awesome as this was, Jesse simply did not understand why everyone saw his power as normal. His entire life he had been the center of attention, and now that he had something like this nobody really cared. Yeah, they thought it was cool, but just not out of the ordinary. Jesse did not think so. He thought his power was incredible and was not understanding what was going on. There were points in time where he tried to prove to people that his power was truly a gift, by being shot at with a tank missile and then flying it out into space, but to no avail, the response was the same. 
After years of having this power, Jesse did not want it anymore. It had changed the course of his life. He was viewed by people as different, and to be honest, he started to feel himself changing. He wasn’t who he was before, and that angered him even more. He started to really think about what made him him. And this was not it. Why did Superman give me this power? What was the point? Where is Superman? And as he was thinking about superman that very moment, he felt a warm breeze. The same breeze he felt years earlier, and boom Superman appeared. 
Jesse was not sure what to do, he had seen Superman before, but before Superman to Jesse was an iconic hero, here in the present Jesse did not like that superman gave him these powers. Jesse stated that the powers he got change dhis life for the worse, and that nobody would even care that he could fly.  "
125,"All that Maga could think to themselves was, “wow, out of all the possible powers that I could have been gifted with, this is right down there with the worst.” It started about a month prior—they were walking home from the market, looking at a text from their father, & a drop of green fell from their nose, landed on their phone, & sizzled as it rolled down along the metal frame. They arrived shrieking about how they were living in the first three minutes of a bad Twilight Zone episode. A frantic trip to the hospital later, and they found out that, for no reason in particular other than malice on the part of the universe, they can produce acid from anywhere on their body.
Now, a month later, they still aren’t used to the new practices they have to upkeep to make sure they don’t accidentally destroy everything they love. Due to the corrosive nature of their blood, even paper cuts must be swiftly dealt with lest they become a health hazard. Similarly, their tears can’t simply be wiped away any more on a bad allergy day without some strong base nearby to neutralize their acidity. “It’s a wonder I haven’t accidentally waged chemical warfare on my town by now,” they thought. “Golly, what a useful and interesting power to have!” they didn’t think.
This night, however, was different. After weeks of trying to look on the bright side of things and find a possible use for copious amounts of acid pouring constantly from themselves, they believe they have finally found a purpose. They concentrated, and watery green fluid oozed from under "
126,"I do not like you, I think you are weird and annoying.  Their lips are not moving though and they have a smile on their face as they say to a teenage boy, John, “It was so great running in to you today, we should hang out sometime.”  That was weird, he thought to himself and thought maybe it is just my imagination, and continued on with his day and stopped at a diner down the street from his house on his way home from school.  Another teen kid in here. He better not try to take anything, teens are so reckless and disrespectful.  As he walks to get his food, John notices the man behind the counter glaring at him.  He walks up to the counter to pay for his meal and when he receives his change back, John says “Thank you, sir.  Not all teens are bad you know.”  And the man behind the counter’s face changed, almost in surprise and suspicion.  That is when John realized he had the power to read other people’s minds.  At first he loved the idea of it, he would mess with kids at school by calling them out on what they really thought and felt and they would be taken aback as to how he knew what he did.  He didn’t know how he could read other’s minds or when it really began but after having this power and control over someone, he realized he didn’t like having such power anymore.  Sometimes he would be able to know what someone was thinking and it wouldn’t always be something he wanted to know, especially if it were his close friends or even his family thinking something hurtful regardless of how much they loved and cared for him.  John began to recognize the importance of privacy, and how he had abused it.  At first he had thought that he had an “inside” to what other people wish they could have, a gift almost, but then he began to notice that it did more harm than it did good, for somethings are truly best let unsaid.

127,"Fred awoke in the middle of he night for no particular reason. 6 am. Earlier than he had hoped given the busy life he’d been leading the past few weeks. Work has been hell. Not in the casual way that some of us tend to contemplate hell. More in the burning, why am I here, won’t someone please give me a drink of water so I can survive this place kind of hell. Ana is there though. Laying beside fred, fast asleep. At least she’ll get to sleep in a bit before the sun comes up in a half hour. Fred creeps out of bed so as not to wake Ana. She looks absolutely lovely cuddled up there in the bed with the majority of blankets tucked around here as she tossed and turned through out the night and stole most of them hahah. 
Fred tiptoed his way to the kitchen, eager to make the most out of his early waking by surprising Ana with breakfast. He got out a carton of milk from the fridge, some eggs, and bread for the cubboard and set out to make some fresh toast. The sun started to poke out in the horrizen, bringing a bit more color to the room. Vanilla! French toast needs a bit of something sweet to give one that “I’ve just had a tasty treat” feeling. Fred returns to the fridge but can’t help to hesitate a moment. Ana is a school teacher, and Fred is but a low worker grunt in finance, trying to inch his way forward in life so that he may attain some level of financial success, or at least enough to satisfy his and Ana’s thirst for travel. Brazil, Portugal, Thailand, Bali, Dubai, and more. Fred gazes at the pictures of destinations that he and Ana keep on the fridge to motivate them. Closing his eyes, he takes a breath in and pictures it. He can feel the sand beneath his toes and the surfboard under his arm.
Wait. He can actually feel the sand under his toes and the surfboard under his arm. He gasps and the board drops, cracking a bit on the hard packed  sand that is STUNNING against the backdrop of the crystal blue water, crashing waves, and jungle vegetation of Padaang Padaang, the famed and barreling Left of Bali’s south coast. His hands come to his mouth and his eyes close again. Ana. And he’s in bed. Sand still between his toes. He’s in his boxers and Ana has just woken startled. “Don’t jump on the bed like that it’s not even 6:30 ya dick, what’s the matter with you!”. What’s the matter indeed. 
Fred looks at Ana, kisses her, holds her tight, closes his eyes, and the two lay in the same position, but are now in the Red Wood forests of West Marin with a gentle waterfall in the background. Now Ana is sure that this is a dream. Before she can remark, Fred takes her hand again and squeezes it tight, closes his eyes and thinks of the Moon. Poor choice. Not much oxygen or atmosphere on the moon. They couple floats about for less than a second before they find themselves, still in their morning garments in a paddle boat in Venice accompanied by a particularly overweight pair of American tourists. Fred laughs, apologizes and steps of the table that he had just landed on, wiping the Bri, bread, and jam off his boxers and moving to pick up the toppled over bottle of wine. Ana is in a state of amazement. Transfixed. Unable to utter even a word. Fred moves again and kisses his wife, closes his eyes, and they are back in bed again, embracing."
128," Sarah thought herself as an average girl, just going through the motions of a typical high life. She never thought herself to be special or have some quality that made her stand out from the crowd. Sarah saw those popular girls in school but never cared to be just like them. She liked being invisible. She never thought to have that desire to know what others were thinking. She found comfort in silence and independence.
One morning she woke up, fifteen minutes before her chemistry lab class. In a frantic hurry she sprung out of bed, got out of her pajamas, threw on the first thing she saw, and ran out the door. Never has she been late to anything. If at all, she would always be the first person to arrive. Hopping on her bike, she sped as fast as she could, not paying attention to anything around her. 
All of a sudden, a truck came zooming by. The next thing she knew, Sarah wakes up in a white hospital room dressed in a blue gown. “Sarah, you’ve been in an accident,” the doctor says. “You’ve been here for about a month and you are just waking up from a coma.” 
Sarah could not believe what she was hearing. Sarah just sat there, confused and dazed. She was looking at the doctor and heard him say, “Wow, it’s a miracle she woke up. I thought she wouldn’t make it, given her condition.” But the strangest thing is, she didn’t see him move his mouth. “What is going on,” thought Sarah. In a few hours, her parents came. “Sarah! My baby. Are you okay? Are you hurt?” cries her mom. I thought I was going to lose her. Thank the Lord. I don’t know what I would have done. Sarah heard this in her mother’s voice. But again, she didn’t see her move her lips or open her mouth. Thank heavens, my baby girl is okay. She heard this in her father’s voice. It was then that Sarah realized that she could hear people’s thoughts. 
All this time she found comfort in not knowing what others were thinking. Now she has can’t help but hear anything but that. Sarah had to decide, does she reject this gift that she has given, or does she use it to help those who need it most?"
129,"It was just a normal day inside and outside John’s house. His mom was doing the dishes and cooking lunch as usual, his dad was out mowing the lawn, and his little brother was out playing with their dog. This was like a routine to John, since nothing too exciting or new ever happened to John. He’s lived like this for the past nineteen years and he’s happy with it. As John opened the door to walk out his room to get the lunch his mom made for him, the door knob completely fell off. He was very astonished but didn’t think much of it. He set it down and went down the stairs to let his dad know so he can fix it later. His dad said, “Already? I just fixed it yesterday. Strange.” John was a little weirded out, but still, didn’t think much of it. After eating dinner with his family, John decides to play fetch with his dog outside. He got a ball and without much effort, threw it out on the field. Surprisingly, he shot it so impossibly far out that the dog got confused. John was also confused himself. The ball disappeared in the air as if some superhuman threw it. At this moment, John was feeling a little frightened. He didn’t want to tell his parents because he’d feel as if they’re freak out more and make him feel worse. John then decided to test what he can do. He began to think about how the door knob easily came off when he tried to twist it and how effortlessly the ball went into the sky. He came to the conclusion that he had the power of strength. Trying to hide away from his parents, John decided to sneak off into a vacant area to test his new power. It was dark, which was a perfect setting for John to do whatever he wanted. The first thing John did was punch a cement wall. A little risky for the first trial, but John wanted to know for sure if what he thinks is real. A little hesitant for the punch at first, John gave the cement wall a little nudge and the wall crackled down a little and made a dent in the wall. At this point of time, John was scared but also excited. He began to think about all the things he could do with this superhuman power. He began throwing the dumpsters around him over his head and tried to find heavy things just to showcase his power. After John has his fun, he decided to go home to his family. He didn’t want to tell them anything yet because he thought they might think he wasn’t human and abandon him. Once he came home, no one was awake so he just quietly went into his room. Surprisingly, his mom was waiting for him at his bed. Her expression wasn’t angry, she just looked normal as if she would’ve been any other day. She said, “John, come sit next to me. I just want to say a few words and you can go to bed.” John felt a little uncomfortable, but wanted to hear what his mother had to say. She said, “I’m sorry for not giving you an exciting life son. I know our daily lives are like boring routines and I’m sorry for that. I want to try make things more spontaneous and fun for you and your brother, but its hard going out of my comfort zone. I hope you understand. Your dad and I have been talking about this and we want to make changes around this household. What do you say John?” John was a little speechless at first but got really calm and happy. He said, “Thank you mom. I appreciate you and dad taking the time out of your day to talk about this. This would really mean a lot to me and my brother. I love you so much.” She started tearing up and said, “I love you too, John.” Since John felt like he overcame the barrier between his mom and himself, he wanted to tell her about his power. His mom went in for a hug first and John couldn’t help but hug his mom back. As he touched her, he heard her bones crack and her scream. She then collapsed in John’s arms. John didn’t know what to do. His dad and brother came racing in and saw what had happened. John started crying and started to repeat, “I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t mean it, I swear.” Not knowing what to do in this moment, John laid his mom on the bed and ran out the door, breaking parts of the house away. He knew he couldn’t stay here, so he decided to run off to somewhere that he can call home. "
130,"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a small boy born into a wealthy household. His parents were billionaires who had built an empire from the ground up. This caused the boy to become very spoiled, with feelings of entitlement toward anything and everything. As the boy grew older, he decided to venture out and try his own business just like his father. He asked his father for a small loan of one million dollars.
The man soon lost all this money towards failed cruise-ships, clubs, and even his own vodka line. Afterwards, he decided to stick with the empire that his parents had already built, so he decided to extend the hotel business around the globe. The father and son duo built hotels in every corner of the world with their family name emblazoned in big gold font, as bright as the fires from the pits of hell themselves. Once the son gained the hotel empire his dad had built, he thought he could own the world.
So, the next big step for him, was to be a tyrannous ruler, because why not? The citizens of this country knew he was a billionaire with a toupee, but what they didn’t know was that his viewpoints were going to change the world. He fought to get rid of anyone that wasn’t white, to build a big wall with a moat around the castle they all lived in, to take away the rights of women, and to keep the wealthy rich, and the poor poorer. With these promises, he announced he would “Make __ great again!” His supporters rejoiced, the others asked, “When was ___ ever great?” 
Once he came into power due to the weak and dismantled political system of this country, everything fell apart. War after war caused a chaotic uproar as millions were shipped away to places unknown, and as others fought for basic rights and took over the streets with protests. The man realized that he had caused the country to fall apart and was content with it. He would go down as the worst ruler of the country, but that did not faze him for he was on the edge of dying from carcinoma anyways. In the end, climate change ruined the world anyways."
131," Samantha was a first generation college student; her parents worked hard to give her the opportunity of higher education. Post-graduation she received her big break, head of environmental safety for a start-up mining company in southern Nevada. Small projects such as iron ore drilling and underwater wells had kept her fairly busy. She liked her job and felt she was making a difference to both the environment and her community. Though a few states away from her parents in Oregon, Samantha kept in well enough contact with her family and was set on a track to pay off her student loans in the next ten years. Having always been a full time employee as well as a full time student, Samantha knew the value of managing her money and her time. Her natural love of the land came into conflict when she panned through some safety regulation documents one day. Due to a loophole in regulation, she noticed that her company’s safety standards were allowing serious environmental damage to the top soil. Her company classified as a small business which allowed for digging of underground wells in areas inaccessible to local state regulated departments of water and power. Finding a geological map, of the underground river ways, Samantha drove out to affected farms and districts to collect data on possible effects of drought. There was no denying that her mining company was directly correlated in worsening the local water crisis. Samantha had a choice to make: Would she be a whistle blower and risk her job, security, and the shame of her proud parents? Would she wait until the state figured out what her company was doing and face a class action lawsuit? Could she risk the drastic decrease of labor that would ensue, thus being directly responsible for a direct job loss of over half the company? At this moment Samantha realized that the choices she made could have a ripple effect on many people. She was no longer that college student worried about debt and familial pride, her actions (no matter how big or small) had an effect on others who surrounded her. What do you think she did?"
132,"Timmy was a college student that was in his first year of college. He was a kid who enjoyed playing video games and watching Netflix. He moved into the dorms on a Wednesday night. He got together with his group of friends and went out to party. He had fun but when coming back he found a water bottle on the floor. He was thirsty and drank it. He thought it tasted funny but he didn’t mind it. When he woke up he realized that he felt different. When he thought of getting the glass of water from his desk he ‘’magically’’ brought the glass to him. He remembered reading an article of humans are only capable of using ten percent of their brain. He also remembered that the scientist that invested in that topic was a professor at his school. They eventually talked and by that time Timmy was able to control most of his internal system. He knew that with the ability that he has, he can unlock many mysteries that humans had. He eventually got to a point where he could tell exactly how the universe all began. When he told the professor all of this the professor told him that he can make a big foot print of this planet. Being the guy he is Timmy was excited to hear that. 
When Timmy was younger his mother had cancer and watched her suffer for a long time. He still remembers how she felt. So Timmy took a decade trying to find out to treat and ‘’destroy’’ caner. He did. He was able to explain space and time to physicists in a way that was unheard of at the time. He help them solve the biggest theories and questions that they had. "
133,"In the town of Hillville, there was a young boy named Gary who had a mother named Irene, a father named Stephen, and two sisters named Julia and Johanna. Gary was in 3rd grade and attended Monterey Elementary School. Gary was picked on often at school, often called ‘shrimp’ because of his height. He was a shorter kid and because of that he was bullied and hated going to school. His bully was named Ryan, and he was much bigger than him and would call him mean names and throw him in his school locker. Ryan would pester Gary on the walk home from school and the walk there since they lived fairly close by. Sometimes, Gary would leave home earlier to refrain from running into Ryan on the walk to school but Ryan would still manage to pick on Gary at school. Gary told his mom about and she said, “We are going to need to talk to the school about this then because this is unacceptable. “So the next day Irene went into the school to talk to the school about it and Ryan was called into the principal’s office. Gary thought that finally Ryan would stop picking on him, but it only made things worse. Ryan then called Gary a tattletale and a wuss, on top of shrimp and short stuff. At the end of school, Gary ran home with anger and tears running down his face wondering why this had to happen to him. He was so frustrated and ran to the creek near his house and sat there in anguish and tears. He was so sick of being picked on for something that he had no control of. Being ridiculously angry, he picked up a rock, and chucked it into the air, and to his utter surprise the rock he just flung went for miles and miles and miles. He was shocked beyond belief that the rock he had just sprung had managed to go that far. He couldn’t even see the rock anymore. Did he have some sort of super power? He looked at his hands in disbelief and picked up a larger item, a tree branch and flung it and it had also gone for miles. Then, he picked up a boulder resting on the side of the bank of the creek and chucked that for miles and miles. He could not believe his eyes so he ran home and showed his parents. His parents were shocked and concerned at the same time. Gary had a power: super strength. This super strength made him want to punch Ryan in the face for all the things he had done to him. Gary realized that he may have been smaller than Ryan, but he wasn’t weaker. On his walk to school, he showed everyone his super strength, and even Ryan caught a glimpse. Ryan said,” Who cares? You’re still a shrimp.” With all his might, Gary refrained himself from punching Ryan and stated “You may be taller than me Ryan, but you are not stronger than me. Just like that boulder, I could toss you for miles and miles, but I know that im the bigger person and would never want anyone, including you, to make them feel the way you made me feel. Quit calling me names and lets just all get along.” Ryan apologized and agreed to not call Gary names. Gary could have used his powers for harm, but he used them for good and found there to be no reason to hurt Ryan the way Ryan had hurt him. Gary’s super strength gave him the strength the stick up for himself which was something he needed all along.  "
